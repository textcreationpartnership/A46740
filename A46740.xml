            <title>Usury stated overthrown: or, usuries champions with their auxiliaries, shamefully disarmed and beaten by an answer to its chief champion, which lately apeared in print to defend it. And Godliness epitomized by Christopher Jelinger, M.A. Beza upon Matth. May a man with a safe conscience lend upon usury? No surely. And holy Usher, Arch-Bishop of Armagh, in his Body of divinity, pag. 300. Q. What is that which we call usury? It is lending in expectation of certain gain. So he well stateth it against usury ill stated by T. P. Q. What do you think of it? If we speak of that properly, which the scripture condemneth, it is a most wicked and unlawful contract; which if we live and die in, without repentance, we are excluded out of the Kingdom of Heaven. Psal. 15.1,5. Ezek. 18.12,13. and chap. 22. But there is much questioning, which is that usury which the scripture  condemneth. Therefore it will be our wisdom wholly to forbear it, and not to put our souls, which are of more value than the whole world, upon nice discourses, and subtil distinctions. Thus this holy man.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>Benediction; ſo, as that when your Lordſhip has peruſed and read the ſame, you will uſe them alſo for your Eternal Good, labouring as for Life, to have that ſweet Society with Jeſus Chriſt which Saints have both Day and Night, by an Holy Walking with his Great and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Majeſty in his Celeſtial Galleries and Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Places,</hi> Cant. 7.5. <hi>and fighting the good and great Fight of Faith, as one of his valiant Warriers, wreſtling with God moſt mightily, to overcome God. O Great Sir! may it pleaſe your Honour, to give your mind to theſe great things more than ever, and to do them; for then how rich you would be in God on a ſudden! and how ſure of Heaven! for Heaven would then not only be above you, but alſo in you:</hi> Rom. 14.17. <hi>and you would be able to ſay tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Now I have enough: for, loe what a Life I now live, living by the Faith of the Son of God who loved me, and gave himſelf for me!</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>and ſpending my whole time with my Love Chriſt, by Night as well as by Day, to ſatiate my longing deſire with his moſt ſweet So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety! and Oh the unexpreſſible Peace that I now have within; being aſſured in my Heart, that with everlaſting Bliſs I ſhall be bleſſed! and Oh the longing Joy which does now ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round me! and what a Globe of Glory becircles me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>! Oh, Noble Sir, 'tis true Nobility for a Man to be a Worſhipper of God, a good Reader
<pb facs="tcp:32640:6"/>of God's Book, a good Keeper of Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Society with the higheſt Majeſty; for that will bring us to the greateſt Riches and Felicity. As for this World's Riches, you have enough of them, bleſſed be God: but one dram of Spiritul Grace, one Glimpſe of</hi> Jehovah<hi>'s Face, one Glance from one of Chriſt's Love-like Eyes, one Drop of his precious-Blood, one Draught of his ſweeteſt Wines of Love, one Sip of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Conſolations, will do you more good than all this World's Goods. And therefore, let that be thought upon, and laboured after, above all things: for then, I ſay again, you will be able to echoe forth theſe Words from your very Heart, and from an undeceiving Experience: Oh, what an Ocean of ineffable Delights do now overflow me, and what a Maſs of Heaven's Bliſs ſurrounds me! But I intend to cloſe up this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle with praying thus. May Heaven's Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing be dropped down upon my poor Labours, and upon the Head of this Noble Lord to whom I exarate and write theſe Lines; that he, reading and practiſing the ſame on Earth, may reap the benefit thereof above in Heaven; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving an Eternal and Immarceſſible Crown of Glory.</hi>

(ſo it is in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>) being all for Prayer, and ſpending a great part of your
<pb facs="tcp:32640:8"/>time in Prayer. I have read of a Godly Miniſter, that of twenty four Hours, he ſpent eight in Prayer; which is not expected of every body, nor required of your Honour; but that you, and all Chriſt's Saints ſpend much time in Prayer: Pray often, and even by Night as well as by Day, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.1, 7, 8. Well, Great Sir, I truſt in God that he will lead you into all the Truths and things which here you are pointed to: and that thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you will lead ſuch a Ceraphical, Celeſtial and Tranſcendental Life for Holineſs, as that being ecſtaſied in your Spirit, you will be able to ſay, O! what a Heaven! what a Paradiſe! what a Beatity doth circumſcribe me! Heaven being in my very Heart, and my Heart in Heaven. Heaven is high, I confeſs; but not too high for Strivers, Wreſtlers, for holy Livers: and therefore let us ſtrive, Great Sir, as for Life, to enter into Life by a ſweet and holy Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with our dear Jeſus, whoſe Life was a moſt ſtrict, moſt pious, moſt Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life indeed; that we may live with his moſt bleſſed Majeſty in Bliſs and Beatity, Greatneſs and Gladneſs, Peace and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to all Eternity.

About my future proceedings: That I intending to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf with my promiſed three practical Uſury Books, to whom three or four more will be added, I ſhall no more ſo immerſe my ſelf, as I have done, into the controverſial Sea of Uſury, becauſe I am ſo much ſtricken in age, and may, like aged Sea-men, well be excuſed from going to ſuch a Sea again; as one which deſires to labour for Heaven above all Terrene Concerns, and to end the remainder of his little time in a Calm; ſtriving moſt of all to enter into that everlaſting Reſt
<pb facs="tcp:32640:10"/>which is to come, by believing, and a practical maintaining of good works, according to <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.8.</p>
            <p>But if any ſhall oppoſe what I have already written againſt Uſury in this Book, and in my former, I may happily anſwer by a few Animadverſions upon that which was never before objected, and anſwered. And ſo I will cloſe up this third <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,</hi> with that notable Saying of that moſt wiſe King; <hi>And further, by theſe, my Son, be admoniſhed, of making many Books there is no end; and much ſtudy is weariſomneſs of the Fleſh,</hi> [eſpecially about controverſial matters.] <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.12.</p>
            <p n="4">4. About this preſent Writing, let the Reader take this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement. 1. That altogether unexpectedly, I have been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted and abuſed by cruel mockings, according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36. and grievous charges of things which I never did or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed; and Uſury it ſelf by name: which made me ſtir for my defence, as the leaſt Worm that is will do when it is trod upon. 2. That his and other Men's Letters about Uſury ſent to me, I ſhall not
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>For juſt cauſes; imitating in it Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet: <hi>who alſo would not anſwer his Adverſaries Letter, but his Book called</hi> Sure Footing.</note> anſwer here. 3. That I was ſent unto by a certain Meſſenger which is yet living; who told me expreſly, that I muſt anſwer firſt ſuch a one, who had written againſt me, before I did print my other three Books which are to come. So that I was even challenged and provoked to write, for the ſaving of my Credit. 4. That being informed how the ſame Pamphlet which was ſent to me, was ſent up to be printed, I ſtill waited to ſee it publiſhed very near two Years, that I might anſwer ſo as that we might not differ in Copies. But when I ſaw that no ſuch Pamphlet did come forth, I reſolved to tarry no longer, being ready, and much ſpurred on by others who did long to ſee my Anſwer to the ſaid Pamphlet, ſcattered up and down to my diſgrace, I reſolved to tarry no longer, but to proceed to the publiſhing of my Anſwer to the ſaid Manuſcript: but in civility, I would not divulge the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's name, nor any others, which ſince the publiſhing my Treatiſe againſt Uſury, have written to me: imitating bleſſed <hi>Bolton,</hi> who did the like; contenting himſelf with putting down of theſe two Letters, M. <hi>S.</hi> only. I add, that I was willing to follow in this, B. <hi>Downam</hi> alſo; who, in his moſt excellent Book againſt Uſury, upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. confutes a great
<pb facs="tcp:32640:11"/>part of a Manuſcript, without naming the Author thereof: and well known it is, that a number of other Writers beſides, have done the like. Now, my moſt hearty prayer to God is, that he will bedew this my Confutation with his Celeſtial Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction; ſo as that his holy Name may be glorified, and many a poor Uſurer's Soul reſcued from everlaſting Burnings, and graciouſly entranced into God's holy Hill, called Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; there to dwell in fulneſs of Jucundity, unutterable tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, bleſſed Immortality, immortal Felicity, to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
            <p>But upon new Incomes, I muſt,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Declare yet farther, that in this my proceeding, I am reſolved to build and to depend principally upon the ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the holy Scriptures; which my Adverſaries are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of: and not upon Man's Reaſon; though ſecondarily I uſe Reaſon too. If there were a difference between me and my Antagoniſts about Men's
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

For how far Reaſon will go, and yet without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding, that moſt learned Man, Doctor <hi>Cudworth,</hi> in his <hi>True Intellectual Syſtem on the Univerſe,</hi> ſheweth. For, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his indefatigable Labours and pains exantlated and taken therein, he muſt be a Sceptick in ſeveral things and places. I will inſtance but in two.</p>

            <p n="6">6. But beſides, I cannot omit here a moſt memorable Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative which was brought to me after the writing of this Book, concerning a certain Uſurer; who living not far from the place of mine aboad, and having got a very great Eſtate by Uſury, though (as I am told, he took Uſe but after the ordinary rate of this Land, and no more) fell ſick, and ſent for a moſt God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned Miniſter, who was named to me; and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing how heavy that Sin of Uſury lay upon his troubled Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, deſired him, that as he would anſwer it at that great day of Judgment, he would declare unto him his judgment concerning that Sin. Whereunto the ſaid Godly Miniſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned this Anſwer; that, <hi>Except he repented, and made reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, he could not be ſaved.</hi> Whereupon he departed. As for his Eſtate, that as the Relater told me, did melt away. Which I deſire may awaken Uſurers, and deter them from their curſed practiſes.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I adviſe the Reader, if he be an Uſurer, that he will no longer delude himſelf with this, That multitudes follow that trade, and put out their Money upon Uſury: conſidering that multitudes alſo, both in <hi>England,</hi> and beyond the Seas, in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in <hi>Holland</hi> eſpecially, break and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the Chriſtian Sabbath, by working, ſhooting, buying and ſelling, as I have ſeen; ſaying, that the Law which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth ſuch a ſtrict keeping of the Sabbath as the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment mentioneth, was given to the Jews, and does not bind us: and that thoſe which are ſo preciſe in the obſervation of our Lord's Day, do Judaize: Even as Uſuries Defendants and Committents ſay now, that the Law made againſt Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry concerned the Jews, and doth not bind us. Both which I refer to anſwer for what they ſay, to that great day of the Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:32640:12"/>which is to come; adding no more to this Paragraph now, but this; that we muſt not follow a multitude to do evil.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I ſhall ſuper-add this; for that becauſe ſome may blame me becauſe I ſtand ſo overmuch in this Controverſie upon the ancient Fathers, which, with <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> I call thoſe Immortal Souls, joyning the holy Prophets with them; I ſhall therefore thus Apologize for my ſelf. If I were to diſpute of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the old Millenaries whom the new ones follow, or of the time of Antichriſt's coming: which two things I name, becauſe of our late Fifth-Monarchy Men, and thoſe which hold that the Pope is not that Antichriſt which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of;

               <hi>Irenaeus</hi> holds (and it is ſaid, he had it of <hi>Papias</hi> too) that in the end of the World Antichriſt ſhould come, and hold it not full four Years.

<pb facs="tcp:32640:12"/>in theſe two things; but as for all Uſury, that all the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with one mouth, one conſent, one ſpirit, condemn as unlawful, and interdicted by the holy Scriptures; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am ſo for thoſe immortal Souls, the holy Fathers I mean, which alſo moſt ſweetly harmonize with thoſe immortal Souls which we call the Lords <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:32640:13"/>preaching of Goſpel-Miniſters, which by the Scriptures cried them down.

            <p n="1">I. <hi>ABout the</hi> Heydelberg-<hi>Catechiſm, which my chief Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary pretends to make for Uſury againſt me; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I have three things to ſay, having read the ſaid Catechiſm, and the Expoſition of it; yea, having learned the ſaid Catechiſm by heart, when I was young.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The firſt is, that I find no ſuch thing in the Catechiſm it ſelf as favours Uſury; nor could there be, becauſe</hi> Urſin, <hi>who made it himſelf, was againſt Uſury as well as my ſelf, as in this Book I ſhew it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Author of the Expoſition of it could do no other but write of Uſury as he doth, and as others do, if he would be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That I do highly commend him for all this, becauſe he writ more preciſely for the ſtrict keeping the Lord's Day than any of that Country, that I have ſeen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>About the unjuſt charge, whereby I am charged with Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; becauſe the School-men, and I, with my Brethren, are joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt Uſury. The words of the charge are theſe,</hi> The Man is become as one of them. <hi>Whereunto I deſire to anſwer a little more fully than yet I have done, and that three ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He might as well have ſaid that I am become a</hi> Mahometan, <hi>becauſe</hi> Mahomet <hi>is againſt Uſury too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That I am become a Heathen, becauſe the Heathen and I agree in the point of Uſury: they writing againſt it, as I do; even moſt bitterly too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>I anſwer, Am I as one of the Papiſts? who,</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe I would not become a Papiſt, choſe rather, like</hi> Moſes, <hi>to ſuffer Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction with the people of God, and to loſe, and to leave all that I
<pb facs="tcp:32640:14"/>was owner of, and to live as an exiled man in a ſtrange Country.</hi> 2. <hi>And whereas ſome Britiſh Divines do queſtion it, whether the Pope be Antichriſt, or whether the great Antichriſt be yet to come; have lately declared, and do declare, that it is as clear to me as the Sun, that he is the Antichriſt, and that</hi> Rome <hi>is</hi> Babylon: <hi>it being ſo evident to others alſo, even Papiſts themſelves, that it is</hi> viz.

               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have received your Lines, wherein you deſire me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my Sentiments concerning your Anſwers to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer's Champion: and therefore I ſhall ſay thus much; <hi>viz.</hi> That I am very well ſatisfied with them; and do hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire that your ſucceſs of them in the World might be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to your deſign. It is to me a matter of great lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that a crime (in my opinion ſo notorious) ſhould find any Advocate to plead for it: for I am ſenſible how much greater influence thoſe Arguments have on the credit of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that comply with their carnal intereſt, than thoſe which deſign their greater benefit, and to bring them into the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ever bleſſed God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, let your Examiner paſs never ſo ſevere a cenſure on you, whilſt you plead the Lord's Cauſe, you have this comfort, that your reward is with him. And though truth may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by its Adverſaries for a while, yet the force of it is ſuch, that it will prevail at laſt. It were indeed to be wiſhed that men would open their eyes to behold it betimes: but if the World hath ſo far bewitched them, that they either cannot, or will not; ſure I am, that the day of Tryal will make it clear. I pray God that men would ſuffer themſelves to be convinced, before the Judgment-day. Sir, I have no more to ſay, but that I am and ſhall be an Orator at the Throne of Grace for you, that the ſame holy Spirit that hath hitherto moved you in the defence of ſo good a Cauſe, would aſſiſt you ſtill, both to the perfecting of this work, and what elſe you may have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the Glory of God, and the profit of Man-kind; and that you may never want Champions for God's Cauſe in theſe famous Iſlands; that Satan's Kingdom may not only be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but altogether ſhattered, and Glory may dwell in our Lands, that we may be the Field which the Lord God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth to bleſs. Which muſt be the concluſion of the hearty Lines of him who is ſincerely,</p>

                  <p>In the next place, I ſhall, according to my uſual proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. premiſe a Preface, and place it next to my Prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Heavens,</hi> which are ſo clothed with ſhining light, ſo beautiful with a Canopy of gayeſt colours, ſo beſpangled with ſparkling Diamonds, <hi>[the Stars I mean]</hi> declare the glory of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1. But ſo do not our <hi>Uſurers.</hi> For they do rather, as much as in them lieth, unglorifie God; in that,</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. They are ſo far from declaring the Glory of God, and honouring that great and glorious Majeſty, as that they give great occaſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme, as did <hi>David</hi> by his Adultery and Murther, Both which, grave and great

                  <p>And I wondred alſo, that when all other Miniſters were ſilent; yea, diverſe both Prelatical and Anti-prelatical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines encouraged me by Letters and otherwiſe, by and in diſcourſes, he only ſhould riſe up in Arms againſt me, in deteſtable Uſuries Defence.</p>

<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Aug. <hi>in</hi> Pſal. 15.</note> And ſo to go on with this my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, I reſolved upon three things.</p>

                        <hi>B.</hi> Downam, <hi>in</hi> Pſal. 15.</note> Biſhop <hi>Downam,</hi> by counterfeit exchanging; which I, for my part, ſhall call Exchange bordering upon Uſury. The manner of its committing is this; When Money is delivered upon Bills of Exchange, with mention of the places, not that the Bills ſhould be tranſported for the ſatisfying of the Creditor
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32640:22"/>beyond the Seas; but that the Lender, keeping the Bills at home with him, may have the like Allowance which Merchants have for the ſame time, dealing by Exchange and Rechange betwixt the places named.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of this practice is, becauſe their Gain is greater than any other; which is tolerated by ſome Magiſtrates: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that they which put forth their Money in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Exchange are ſuppoſed to get after 16 or 20 in the 100. So that therefore this Exchange may be called <hi>Cambium ſiccum, Dry Exchange,</hi> becauſe it is void of Charity.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is alſo a kind of adventuring, which is but a cloak of Uſury; When a Man covenants for Gain in lending under a pretence of hazard, when all the while he intends to enſure; and ſo the Principal is not hazarded. And ſo many a Man lendeth fifty pounds, if himſelf and two or three others which he ſhall name, or any of them, ſhall be alive at the twelve Months end, that the Debtor ſhall pay him fifty five pounds; otherwiſe he ſhall pay but forty five pounds: For if he ſhould name but one, it were twenty to one that he ſhould be living at the Years end; but naming three, it is more than twenty to one, but that ſome one of the three ſhall ſurvive.</p>
                  <p>This famous <hi>Downam</hi> alſo judgeth to be a cloaked Uſury.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There is likewiſe a kind of pretended free Lending, which is but a Cloak of Uſury. As, when a Man lendeth fifty pounds; much of it being light Money, and ſuch as will not paſs; as being clipped, or Braſs coloured over, with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to pay him again ſo much in good and paſſable Coyn. Such was the Uſury which ſome practiſed in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s time, a little before the Captivity. For, as ſome write, they having ordained a new Shekel, exceeding the old thirty two Grains; ſo that whereas the Civil, or <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, which was but half of the holy Shekel, weighed an hundred and ſixty Grains, the new weighed an hundred ninety and two: they would lend after the old Shekel, but they would be paid according to the new.</p>
                  <p>More, much more could be ſaid of this Palliate Uſury: for it is juſt like one <hi>Perielimenus;</hi> who, to beguile others for the enriching of himſelf, ſometimes would be like a Fowl, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times like a Bee, ſometimes like an Ant, ſometimes like a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; yea, ſaith my Author,

The matter is not ſo; but Sheba <hi>the Son of</hi> Bichrie, the wilful and obſtinate Uſurer I mean; otherwiſe, the common Uſurer who makes a Trade of that Uſury which God interdicts and condemneth, called <hi>Neſheck</hi> and <hi>Tarbith;</hi> that is, Uſurious Encreaſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.13. who lifts up himſelf againſt the King of Kings, and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth againſt him, and his Commands concerning Uſury; againſt him I preach Damnation, as one who may well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sheba,</hi> becauſe he hath <hi>Seven Abominations</hi> in his heart, as the Scripture ſpeaketh of the Wicked, as he is, if any be among us, the Son of <hi>Bichrie,</hi> as ſome read it, becauſe he is in <hi>Aries,</hi> which is not only a Celeſtial Sign, but alſo a Warlike Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment uſed againſt a place or King beſieged, and rebelled againſt, as the Uſurer is, who is an Inſtrument acted by Satan, and uſed againſt the Great King, againſt whom he fighteth: againſt him, even this Uſurer, I ſay, that I am; telling him, that <hi>except he repent, he ſhall ſurely die;</hi> that is, he ſhall be damned, and burn in the flames of Hell everlaſtingly, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.13. and never dwell in God's Holy Hill above, as thoſe who do not put forth their Money to Uſury, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.

                  <p>I'll inſtauce in two only, reſerving many more for another Anſwer, which is to come upon another account.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Uſury is interdicted in both Teſtaments. In the Old firſt, by a general conſent; and in the New alſo, as well as old, by the Verdict of whole Councils and Univerſities.</p>
                  <p>I'll inſtance in one of each. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Lateran Council,</hi> twice it is aſſerted by two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty Biſhops, or more, <hi>That Uſury is forbidden in both the Volumes of the Bible.</hi> And again, <hi>The Crime of Uſury is deteſted by both Teſtaments.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. In the Univerſity of <hi>Wittenbergh:</hi> Whoſe words are in its firſt Theſis or Poſition, <hi>Foraſmuch as Uſuries, not only by a poſitive Law, but alſo by both the Old and New Teſtaments, are, as in themſelves evil, prohibited by God,</hi> &amp;c. See the reſt in my <hi>Uſurer Caſt,</hi> p. 47.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon it followeth, that Damnation muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if what both affirm be proved. So that,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may be made good by Arguments and Proofs, that in the New Teſtament, Uſury is interdicted, as well as in the Old; and ſo conſequently condemned as a breach of God's Prohibition.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

As for Example,</p>
                  <p>The prophaning of the Chriſtian Sabbath is not mentioned, nor interdicted expreſly, but conſequently, becauſe it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led The Lord's Day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. Whereupon it followeth, that we muſt do the Lord's Work; and not prophane it, by doing the Devil's work.</p>

                  <p>The Letter it ſelf now follows, containing this Narrative.</p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Greſham,</hi> a Merchant, failing from <hi>Falerno,</hi> where dwelt the aforeſaid great Uſurer, called <hi>Antonio the Rich;</hi> who at one time had two Kingdoms mortgaged to him by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> (who is a great Borrower) and being croſſed by contrary Winds, was conſtrained to Anchor near
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32640:30"/>Mount <hi>Aetna.</hi> Now, about Mid-day, when for certain hours it accuſtomarily forbeareth to flame, he aſcended the Mount with eight of the Sailers; and approaching as near the Vent as they durſt, amongſt other noiſes, they heard a Voice cry aloud, <hi>Diſpatch, diſpatch; the rich</hi> Antonio <hi>is a coming.</hi> Terrified therewith, they deſcended; and anon the Mountain evaporated Fire: but from ſo diſmal a place they made all the haſte they could when the Winds were ſtill. And deſiring much to know more of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they returned to <hi>Falerno:</hi> and forthwith enquiring of ANTONIO, it was told them, that he was dead; and computing the time, did find it to agree with the very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant that the Voice was heard by them. <hi>Greſham</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this, at his Return, to the King; and the Mariners being called before him, confirmed by Oath the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In <hi>Greſham</hi> himſelf (as it was reported) it wrought ſo deep an Impreſſion, that he gave over all Traffick; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing his Goods, a part to his Kindſ-folk, the reſt to good Uſes, retaining only a Competency for himſelf; and ſo ſpent his time in a voluntary Devotion.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Oh dreadful! Oh, that the poor condemned Uſurer would ſeriouſly mind all this, and give over his damnable Uſury, that he may not come and be caſt into theſe everlaſting Burnings! for that will be the Portion of every impenitent Uſurer; after he hath breathed out his laſt, moſt ugly Devils will immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry his Soul into that Lake that flameth like Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> and burneth with Fire and Brimſtone, which is the Second Death, threatned againſt the Uſurer, which takes Biting and ENCREASE, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.13. Confeſs I do, that the more cruel a Biter any Uſurer is, the hotter (if any can be) and the deeper Damnation he will have for his Part and Portion: but he that ſhall have the leaſt Torment in that woful place, and mercileſs fire, ſhall have ſo much as will make him cry out with horrid and helliſh Anguiſh; <hi>Who can dwell in theſe ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Burnings.</hi> Iſa. 33.12.

                  <p>Here are two great Biſhops on my ſide, and an old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Men may be learned, and yet not ſerious; I mean, ſo ſerious as to conſider what a great and grievous Sin Uſury is. And again, May be not only ſerious, but alſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and yet not truly Godly; <hi>Having but a form of Godlineſs, and denying the power thereof,</hi> eſpecially in theſe laſt times, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. So that no wonder it is if ſuch turn Uſurers in ſuch an Age wherein Men are ſo much carried with Gain: and that ſo much the rather, becauſe even ſome Miniſters are become Uſurers, and ſhew them the way to it by their ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Which cauſed a very Able, Learned and Godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to break out into theſe Expreſſions after he had ſeen my

                     <hi>Uſurer Caſt: Miniſters now turn Uſurers, and therefore ſo many Hearers turn Uſurers too: I am, and ever was againſt it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But ſuppoſe Men be truly Godly, and lend and take Uſe or Gain, as my Adverſary calls it, then the words of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid great Authors are to be underſtood thus, that no Godly Man ever uſed it as it is now practiſed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p>But Finally, I muſt ſuper-add one thing which I had almoſt forgotten; as namely, That I much wonder at my Adverſary's having ſo much to do here with cruelly Biting and Griping Uſury and Uſurers, to vent and to excuſe his moderate Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by it. Becauſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I underſtand by ſuch as hear him, that in his preaching they ſhall not hear him ſpeak againſt any Uſury. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is well known, that there are not ſo over-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch cruelly biting Uſurers, who take all Advantages, Mortgages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to uſe his own Expreſſions: I, for my part, hear but of a few, and thoſe few do not go untold of it by me, and my Brethren; but rather a little more than by him and his Brethren. And ſo they were ſpoken againſt by the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (but not only.)</p>

                     <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> who, when ſome Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers were ſo cruel as that they would arreſt the very dead Corpſes of their Borrowers, not only ſpake againſt them, but alſo cauſed the ſaid dead Bodies to be carried to their very Houſes: and yet, when he came to ſhew what interdicted and damnable Uſury is, he defined it as I and others define it.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. And beſides all this, becauſe I obſerve generally, when I hear Men ſpeak of and againſt Uſurers, they call every Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon Uſury, and for Gain, an Uſurer, whether he be a ſmall one, or a great one, that lendeth Thouſands, and is content with Six in the Hundred, which they call moderate Gain, <hi>alias</hi> Uſury, and craves and looketh for no more: as alſo, they call thee, who art ſuch a Lender, and readeſt theſe Lines, a Uſurer, do what thou canſt, and ſay what thou wilt of and for moderate Uſury; and tell as much as thou canſt what a damnable Sin exceſſive Uſury is, and how cruelly it gripes the Poor, though very few, if any, will lend to the Poor: Uſurers being for the Rich only, that can give them good Security, and pay them punctually. I ſay, Men will call thee an Uſurer, as well as the cruelly biting Lender, as long as thou liveſt, and liveſt in the Sin of Uſury; And ſo they will call any of thy Brethren that come after thee, as long as <hi>Neſheck</hi> and <hi>Tarbith, Biting</hi> and <hi>Encreaſe,</hi> ſtand coupled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, interdicted together, and condemned together in thy Bible, and by name, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.13.

I for my part, to tell thee the truth here, thy Name, which is <hi>Uſurer,</hi> told almoſt every Day, though thou art aſhamed to call thy ſelf ſo, and not willing that any of thy Neighbours ſhould call thee ſo. So that I ſuppoſe that by this time my chief Antagoniſt's Flouriſh, which even now he made, is come to an end. And that I may now, being out of that Labyrinth which I was in, advance and come to a new Engagement, without any Let or <hi>Remora.</hi> Thus,</p>

Not, quoteth Mr. <hi>Jelinger.</hi> As if a Man might put out another's Money; as Children's Money. Mark his reaſon, for a Man muſt not partake of other Men's Sins, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.2. which I underſtand not: for if putting out to Uſe be a Sin, it is the Man's own Sin that puts out the Money, and not the Child's, that is meerly paſſive. Underſtand, for the preſent, while it is a Child; which is my Anſwer partly, but not fully and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for I obſerve, that commonly Children, when they are grown up, live and continue in the ſame Sin of Uſury, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into thoſe that did put out their Money brought them. And
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:32640:50"/>are they not guilty of making themſelves partakers of ſuch Children's Sin of Uſury, though they do not put out their own Money to Uſury? So that I am much afraid that thoſe Children, living after, and dying in that damnable Sin of Uſury, unto which ſuch Guardians have enchained them, will, when, as Vſurers, they ſhall be, chained up by the Chains of utter Darkneſs in Hell, they will curſe ſuch as have brought them to that unutterable Miſery; ſaying, O <hi>curſed Guardians! if you had not been, we had not been in this woful and dreadful place, nor in ſuch Chains and Bonds, for you were the Men that cauſed Uſury-bonds to be made for us to make us Uſurers, before we, poor Souls, knew what Uſury is.</hi> Thus it is to be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that poor fatherleſs Children will curſe theſe Men ſo in their miſery, who have made them miſerable.

Nor doth my Couſin's Addition make good what is ſaid by him, that the words muſt be underſtood <hi>Limitate;</hi> that is, <hi>Limitately;</hi> as many other Aphoriſms in the ſame Pſalm; becauſe he doth not demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and prove it, but only ſaith it.

                  <p>But here I am deſired to anſwer three Queſtions.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is, whether a Man may lawfully look for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing again, when he lends his Money upon this ſuppoſition of his delay?</p>
                  <p>Whereunto I anſwer, That the aforeſaid <hi>Gabriel Biel,</hi> in the forecited Deciſion, has anſwered it by that which he has ſaid above of this thing, whereto I ſubſcribe.</p>
                  <p>The Second is, whether a Jew might receive this Damage of his Brother, if he kept his Money, lent him, beyond his time, ſuppoſe a quarter or half a Year longer?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Doubtleſs he might if he were much hindred and damaged by it, becauſe God did moſt eminently provide for the Jews Indemnity by a Law formerly cited, and made for them Primarily, and for us Secondarily.</p>
                  <p>The Third Queſtion is, Whether a Lender, that puts out an hundred Pounds for a Year to his own Damage, may not as juſtly receive Satisfaction for that Damage, as well as the next Year, ſuppoſe the time be expired, and Payment delayed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

That to Godly wiſe Men, who do not put their Money upon Uſury, it is no Riddle at all (as he ſaith it is to him) to receive Money upon the Account of Gain ceaſing, or leſs ariſing; and yet to damn a Man that receiveth any thing back for one, two, three or four hundred Pounds lent for ſeveral Years: becauſe the one is againſt the Law of God, <hi>viz.</hi> to receive Uſury, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.19. which he calls Satisfaction, as Uſurers uſe to nominate it, being aſhamed to call it Uſury; and becauſe God condemns it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.12, 15.

That ſo every body adventureth all that he has; for he may loſe all, as <hi>Job;</hi> either by Fire, by Thieves, by Enemies in a time of War, as I did in the <hi>German</hi> Wars: which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, it cannot be ſaid that he is ſuch an Adventurer as the Ship Adventurer is, who taketh for it ſufficient Pawns, or who keeps it by himſelf, under Lock and Key in a Tower, or ſtrong Houſe, Moated, and having a Draw-Bridge to it, as ſome have.</p>
                  <p>To make this more plain, I will illuſtrate it by this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                  <p>We have in <hi>England</hi> two ſorts of Merchants, Merchant-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers, and Merchant Retailers. The Retailers cannot but hazard much, becauſe he muſt truſt often; ſometimes for round Sums, ſometimes for a great while, ſometimes upon the Borrower's bare Word, or Hand to his Book: which Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance no Uſurer will take: and yet no Man calleth him a Merchant-Adventurer, neither is he aſſumed into their Hall and Company. How much leſs then can an Uſurer be called an Adventurer of his Goods, who will neither truſt to a Man's bare Word, nor for any long time; but only from half Year to half Year, and then not without very ſufficient and Landed Men, bound with the Borrower, and ſuch like Secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I anſwer to the Uſurers pretended Adventuring thus.</p>
                  <p>There is a twofold Adventuring.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of the Iſſue:</hi> So the Uſurer adventureth, and no thanks to him for it: for he can do no otherwiſe, becauſe none can ſee the end of things when he begins them, becauſe the All-ſeeing God, by his over-ruling Providence, will work as he pleaſeth, ſometimes beyond Means, ſometimes without Means, ſometimes contrary to Means; ſo that none can tell certainly what will be the End and Iſſue of things, and ſo the Uſurer alſo cannot be altogether ſure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In reſpect of Humane Means:</hi> So the Uſurer maketh his Uſury as ſure and certain as it can be made, and is no Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer, nor can be, in Humane Reaſon.

                  <p>I add, that the Scripture is ſo far from being againſt it, as that it commends rather the vertuous Woman for being like a Merchant's Ship, bringing her Food from afar, which maketh her an Adventurer, adventuring in Ships at Sea, becauſe a Merchant's Ship is expreſly named, and ſhe is ſaid to bring her Food which ſhe adventureth for from afar, <hi>viz.</hi> far from her home. I add, that her adventuring muſt needs be by others too, becauſe Women married to Husbands (as ſhe was) do not uſe to go in Ships (though ſhe be compared to a Ship) but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture by others in their Ships, as it is well known how uſual a thing it is.

                  <p n="1">1. That he doth but briefly ſay, and not prove what he ſaith; diſtinguiſhing between the ſubſtance of the thing mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated, and the value or profit which remains after the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is conſumed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That if that were granted, yet cometh he ſhort of his aim; for it doth not make Uſury lawful: nor are thoſe by his Diſtinction confuted, who hold, That in things which are conſumed in the uſe thereof, their propriety or dominion is not diſtinguiſhed from the uſe thereof; and that therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be taken for the uſe thereof, beyond the value or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion thereof: Becauſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Uſury is forbidden
<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Deut. 23.19. <hi>and</hi> Nehem. 5.</note> expreſly, and therefore is not to be taken, if there were no ſuch Reaſon given againſt it, upon the even now mentioned account.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And alſo becauſe what he ſaith of a Revenue, or value of the thing mutuated, will not hold, at leaſt not generally; for when Corn, Meat, or Oyl is lent, that is eaten in the uſe thereof; ſo if it be Wine, that is conſumed in the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: becauſe that is the uſe of both Meat and Drink. And then what remains? Where ſhall one find it? And if it be Money that is lent, where one purchaſeth Land, or Leaſe, or a Houſe, there are thouſands that do not; for moſt Borrowers are ſuch as borrow for need, to keep themſelves harmleſs, or to get a Maintenance by dealing upon it, and oft-times loſe and ſpend all, Principal, and what they make

                  <p>As for <hi>Rivet,</hi> I ſhall be very civil towards him, becauſe he was my very good Friend in the Univerſity of <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland;</hi> and ſo we parted friendly, as his own Hand, wherewith he wrote his Motto in my Book of Friends, (which I have to ſhew for it) as a perpetual teſtimony of his Favour and our Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, witneſſeth: So that I will only ſet down ſome Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſome of the wifeſt men that ever lived in the world, to ſhew how they differ from him in that which is aſſerted by him, though in other things they may be good Friends enough. That which he holds, is much like that of <hi>Ames;</hi> only he tells of Wine in particular, that ſome ſay of it, (meaning <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> whom I quote for it), That it and the uſe of it cannot be ſeverally ſold. Whereunto he anſwers generally, by a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of an ambiguity in the Word <hi>Uſus,</hi> (as <hi>Ames</hi> alſo doth) which, ſaith he, denotes either the diſtinction of Money, (wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily leaving out other things, which are abſolutely and utterly waſted and conſumed, ſo as that nothing remains), or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity or benefit thereby gotten. Now though the benefit of Money and the right of diſtraction, or the uſe, cannot be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; yet is the diſtraction it ſelf one thing, and the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity or gain, ariſing from that diſtraction, another: the diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:32640:75"/>is but once made and computed, not twice; and gain is reckoned but once, the Principal is rendred for the diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Money, but for an undue Office of lending, and for the time of the Money retained, and that the Creditor could not benefit himſelf by it, a recompenſation is not <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito</hi> poſtulated; mark, poſtulated or required. If my Friend had ſaid, That a recompenſation may be lawfully taken, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be not expected, againſt Chriſt's ſaying, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.35. it had been worthily ſpoken. He concludes thus. Therefore the Reaſon that the Principal is not twice ſold, but a real uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by the Creditor relinquiſhed, and the Debtor received; which is but ſeldom: even as in the ſetting of an Houſe, the uſe thereof is ſeparated from the Houſe. Thus he.</p>
                  <p>Now to anſwer what my Friend aſſerts, and that much more fully than <hi>Ames,</hi> for which I commend him, I will ſet down the Sayings of thoſe Worthies, which I ſhall quote, in anſwer to his, that the World may ſee how they differ, and judge accordingly.</p>

                     <hi>Aquinas,</hi> whoſe words I will ſet down more fully than yet I have done; they are theſe, concerning Wine, thus Engliſhed. <q rend="margQuotes">If a man would ſell Wine ſeverally and by it ſelf, and withal the uſe of that Wine ſeverally and by it ſelf, he ſhould ſell the ſame thing twice, or ſhould ſell that which is not; and ſo he ſhould manifeſtly offend Juſtice: And by the like reaſon he committeth Injuſtice, which lendeth Wine or Wheat to another, and demands two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences for the ſame; one for the thing it ſelf, another for the conſideration of the uſe.</q>
                  </p>

                  <p>Which is anſwered thus: Grant that to be ſo, (for who will borrow any thing, but in reſpect of the real commodity which
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:32640:75"/>is ſuppoſed it will carry with it?) yet by that reaſon a man may take two Prices for many things that are fold: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, I ſell a man Bullion Gold: Now Gold, beſides the Metal it ſelf, which is precious, yea, and beſides the benefit which ariſeth from it, being coined, in Buying and Selling, it has alſo this real commodity, that it's profitable many ways to Phyſick and Health, as a ſovereign and cordial thing. Shall I therefore take one price for the Gold it ſelf, and another for the real commodity of Gold? What's now this, but to ſell one thing twice, and to take two Prices for one Commodity, and ſo to commit a monſtrous Injuſtice, as the Uſurer doth?</p>

                  <p>But I ſee I muſt come to a new Engagement; for thus he ſets upon me, with all fierceneſs and incivility, which he ſhews in all his Pamphlet, occaſioning thereby a very learned and godly man to ſay, That he did not act like a Man, nor like a Chriſtian, much leſs a Miniſter.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, he aſſaults me thus.</p>
                  <p>Having made a ſhort and jeering Preamble firſt, he addeth, We are beholden to him in the next place, that he would let us ſee what manner of thing Uſury is, by its Deſcription. Then on he cometh, charging me, That either I am miſled, or would miſlead others, by my wonted confuſion; and that I rake together whatſoever was ſpoken by any againſt groſſeſt Cheats, Oppreſſions, and Exactions, that have paſſed under the name of Uſury, and diſtribute the ſame with a name and puniſhment attending equally to the moſt oppreſſive Uſury, and to the moſt moderate taker of Uſe for Money lent, with what conſcience let him look to it.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That I wiſh he were not miſled himſelf, nor did miſlead others, by his wonted confounding of Rents, Setting and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Buying and Selling, Intereſt and Damage, with Lending upon Uſury; which things are of a diſparate nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I do no more rake, as he ſaith I do, than the Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ancient Fathers, and Authors and godly Writers new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riſen up againſt that great Idol, which they call Uſury in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:32640:78"/>general, not naming the groſſeſt Oppreſſions, Frauds, Exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that paſſed under the name of Uſury, and that any Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers have ever practiſed the ſame: I ſay, in

But let us ſee how he goes on.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jelinger. 1. <hi>Uſury is a moſt abominable thing.

                  </p>
                  <p>Whereunto my Anſwer is, That I have cauſe and grounds enough to ſay, that Uſury, as it is ſpoken of and againſt, without his Addition and Interpretation <hi>(as ſome have hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it)</hi> is an abomination, or thing to be abhorred, as the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Jelinger <hi>here by the way, ſpeaking of thoſe in</hi> Nehemiah <hi>contended with upon this account, has theſe words;</hi> For they had promiſed him that they would leave Uſury, and reſtore, as I would wiſh you to promiſe ſo too. <hi>Reply.</hi> I have heard of other Advice he gave lately to one concerned on the ſame ſcore, <hi>viz.</hi> Go to the Parties, and ask Forgiveneſs; though the Party were ſufficient to make Reſtitution. Whereunto my Anſwer is:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That I do not adviſe Uſurers to ask Forgiveneſs, as in other Caſes; nor ask one another Forgiveneſs, when they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, in WORDS: but to have the Uſury money, which they have taken, and are to reſtore, forgiven them, in caſe they be not able to reſtore. Which Advice I give as I am <hi>verlatim</hi> adviſed by greater men than he, the Champion, is, even fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:32640:83"/>men indeed, whoſe Conſent I have in this, and ſhall nominate in its proper time and place.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the truth is, that there is one, a Miniſter's Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, which is concerned in this thing, and has been convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by my late Book againſt Uſury, (as others alſo, both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and private Chriſtians, have been both convinced and changed by it) bleſſed be God, and has rendred me hearty thanks for it, and hath made Reſtitution, as all the Country about me knoweth, and talks of it, though ſhe was hardly able to do it, as her Neigbours tell me.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I anſwer, That this Convert took but <hi>Six in the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> which is, as they ſay, Moderated Uſury; and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of that, and made Reſtitution of about Thirty pounds, not being diſſuaded by me from ſo doing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That being a Widow, and ſo conſequently not ſo well able to employ her Money as Men; and being told, that it was lawful for Widows to lend their Money upon Uſury, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſhe would leave it, and made Reſtitution, as aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That this Friend of mine was much blamed for it, and falſly reported to be diſtracted, by ſome who ſhould rather have encouraged her; and yet would not be diſcouraged by them, nor taken off from her Godly courſe, which ſhe took for the eaſing of her troubled Conſcience, for her former ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Vſury.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That I take ſpecial notice of it, that ſuch a one ſhould be ſo converted and changed, that very time when my Treatiſe of Vſury came forth, for the confirmation of it, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and drawing of others to do as ſhe did.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That I look upon it likewiſe as a remarkable ordering of God's all-ruling Providence, that ſuch a thing ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the very ſame Pariſh and Village wherein my chief Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary dwells, but a few doors from him, to convince him that God's Hand is in it, and that he approveth of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, making it evident to all that ſee and know this Change and Succeſs, and how ſhe reproves my chief Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt for defending Vſury.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That I have given my Advice to others too, and to ſome of my neareſt Relations, to make Reſtitution, as ſhe made; which alſo they did, as I can prove it, to ſtop my Adverſaries Mouth.</p>

But this is not all that I have to ſay, to make Uſury infamous: for this is alſo yet behind to be ſpoken, That if the Champion ſhall think that though Uſury hath been ſo infamous in the days of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and of old Writers, yet it is not ſo now in our time, wherein Uſury is ſo common; I, and thouſands more, can tell him, that it is as infamous now alſo among us; for one ſhall hear both Miniſters, that lend their Money upon Uſury, and other rich men, though they look never ſo big, called Uſurers by way of diſgrace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Miniſters: For what do the People ſay, when a man diſcourſes with them about Uſury? Such a Miniſter, ſaith one, is an able man, and preacheth well; but he is an USU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RER, for I know where he hath out ſo much in ſuch a mans hands, who payeth him uſe for it; and ſuch a Miniſter has lent ſo much, it may be Forty, or Fifty, or a Hundred Pounds, to ſuch a Tradeſman, and ſuch a back-handed man, who pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him Uſury for it, who can hardly pay it, ſaith another. And ſuch a Miniſter, ſaith a third, is an Uſurer; for I had Hundreds of him, and paid him Uſe for it; (This I have heard with mine Ears confeſſed.) I muſt confeſs that he abated me ſomewhat, he addeth: But yet, for the Courteſie ſhewn him therein, he calleth him Uſurer: And ſo they do all call ſuch Lenders of Money Uſurers, that is the nick-name they give them, though ſome take no more but ordinary Uſury, or ſomewhat leſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The like is ſaid of other rich men in common talk, if they be Lenders of Money upon Uſury, Such a one is an Uſurer too, though he takes Uſe but after the ordinary rate and ſtint, yea, even thoſe that take much leſs: for I am told of one, by a Friend who borrowed Money of him, that he took but Three in the Hundred for Hundreds, and yet is called an Uſurer for all that, becauſe he lendeth upon Uſury; that is a nick-name, the diſgraceful ſtile and reproachful nuncupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is put upon every Lender upon diſgraceful Uſury; even as in old time alſo thoſe were called Uſurers who took but Five in the Hundred for the Loan of their Money, or much leſs; for ſome had but Four in the Hundred, which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

O monſtrouſly encreaſing Uſury: There is another great Perſon, who has made the like Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in a Tract of his preſented to a Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Uſury, whoſe words I will not now rehearſe, but rather ſet down a little more of that, which the foreſaid Author adds to the words even now mentioned, <q rend="margQuotes">who would not ſell his lands and Goods, and all that he can ſpare, to raiſe a ſtock of money, that thereout he might by Uſury reap ſo great and ſo certain a gain, if once in his Conſcience he were aſſured, that Uſury is lawful?</q> Thus he, and as he ſaith this in General, ſo ſay I of my ſelf in particular, that I would ſell all that I have, and bring it to a ſum of money and lend it out upon U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury too, as others do, if I were ſure that Uſury, which brings ſuch a monſtrous encreaſe were NO SIN: For then I ſhould be freed from all care, trouble, charge, hazards of lives, taxes, reparations, which men that have Livings, and lands are liable unto.</p>
                     <p>I add, and truly, truly, the world might well call us all, that will not put out our money upon fenory, FOOLS, and meer SOTS, that we will not do what lawfully we might do, to get ſuch exceeding great gains.</p>

To go on gradatim, higher and higher, it is a Monſtrous encreaſing thing, in that againſt nature, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer by it (as barren as mony is) doth beget, not only hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds and thouſands, as his lending may be as ſo many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in <hi>infinitum,</hi> even to infinite numbers, which is much more then I ſaid yet, as thus:</p>
                     <p>Whereas a Debtor borroweth but Forty or Fifty pounds, he makes himſelf a debtor not only of ſo many, (in caſe he come not off with his payment) but no man is able to tell of how many, tho he pay but ſix in the 100. which becauſe it may ſeem to be incredible, I will ſet down the words of a great Doctor inſtancing in ten Crowns borrowed, when money was lent out after ten in the 100. A borrower receiveth ten, or ſome ſuch certain number of Crowns, and thereby maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf debtor not only of ſo many, but no man can ſay how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more if the borrower pay but two Crowns over, by the year, in one 100 years he ſhall pay for ten Crowns 200 Crowns: and yet ſhall he ſtill remain debtor for the ten Crowns alſo.</p>
                     <p>And ſhortly after he ſaith further, that thoſe ten Crowns may from Age to Age be only ſaid to continue in the bank, as in ſome places it chanceth, and ſo within a 1000 years they make encreaſe of 2000 Crowns; add hereunto that in caſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:32640:91"/>the borrower do not pay his Uſury in ten years, he is then debtor of twenty Crowns, of ten for the Principal and of other ten for the Uſury, which the Uſurer begetteth and ingendreth (as it were) to the intollerable loſs to the borrower, and the exceſſive gain of himſelf, and yet theſe ten Crowns be not his own all this while, although he pick out ſo great advantage of them, yea, all this while they be no where at all, for in one moment they were

In that the Committant of Uſury againſt the natural Uſe and end of money, which is a formoſt equality, doth intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce into the World a monſtrous deformity, odneſs, and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality, where let me diſcourſe a little of the coming in and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:32640:91"/>uſing of money, and apply what I ſhall ſay concerning it, to the preſent matter of Uſury, but before I go on with this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I will firſt premiſe the ſaying of a wiſe man concerning money, when money is given to loan (as in Uſury it comes moſt times to paſs) there is a ſpecial DEFORMITY alſo in that behalf: And now for a fuller handling of this matter of money, let me declare here, that money was firſt invented by the common conſent of men, eſpecially to ſerve mans ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and commodity in chopping and changing things to and fro; for in the beginning he that lacked any thing, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a new garment he went to another man, that had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiments enough, and brought him ſuch ſtuff whereof himſelf had ſtore, as Cloth perhaps, or skins, or ſome like matter, to make an equal exchange between them both: So that thing for thing was exchanged: and that was the moſt ſimple and natural kind of Traffick between men: but experience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that this at length was incommodious, and would not ſerve every mans turn for ſometimes he that had ſhoes, which I lacked, had alſo cloth and skins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as I, and then he was loth to take my cloth for his ſhooes, ſeeing that he had doth enough of his own. For which cauſe wiſe men deviſed that ſome certain metal ſhould ſerve the turn of all me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, ſo that who ſo needed any ſtuffe, he ſhould take ſuch a kind of metal, or Coyn, to wit lead or leather, and at length braſs, and for that he ſhould receive of any other man whatſoever he needed. Thus metal was at the firſt eſteemed by conſent and delivered by weight: ſo that a pound of braſs ſhould be (for example) the price of a pair of ſhoes: And when it was found troubleſome alſo, eſpecially for them that went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to carry ſuch weight of metal about them, and to ſtand long in weighing it, inſtead of a great deal of braſs, a little Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and leſs Gold was at length invented; yea, then it was alſo further deviſed, that a certain Coyn or print ſhould be ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Silver or Gold ſo that we ſhould not need alwayes to weigh it, but that the very form ſhould ſtraight ſhew the value there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; money therefore was made to ſerve all exchanges and to be the price of all other things, and to ſet forth a form of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the world, and not a deformity as Uſury doth, together with a monſtrous inequality, whereof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For all ſuch things are ſo principally made of God for one certain uſe (as bread to be eaten, wine to be drunken) ſo as that the uſe differs not from the thing it ſelf; becauſe they cannot dure any longer when they are once uſed, but ſtreight are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and become either another thing, or at leaſt another mans goods: Inconſideration whereof he that lendeth me ſuch things, by the lending looſeth the very propriety of them; for elſe I ſhould ſpend another mans goods to his

And here, altho there be expectation of gain, yet there is no Uſury: For in partnerſhip the property of the mony is not transferred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that receiveth it, but remaineth in him which did deliver it, and at his hazard and peril it is employed; and therefore in partnerſhip there is not ſo as much loane, and

                        <pb n="177" facs="tcp:32640:104"/>much leſs Uſury: For, as † <hi>Molinaeus</hi> averreth it in partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the ſubject of Uſury ceaſeth, <hi>viz.</hi> loan, for in loan the property is transferred to the Borrower, and with the property and hazard; ſo that if the Principal miſcarry, it miſcarrieth to the Borrower: It is ſafe to the Lender by the very contract of mutuation or lending, wherein the Borrower ſecureth the Lender by ſuch ſecurity as the Lender thinketh ſufficient, whether it be his Word, Bill, or Bond, or Pawn or Surety for the repayment of the Principal. In this contract of partnerſhip he that delivereth his mony to the other, doth not covenant abſolutely for the reſtitution of his principal, much leſs for gain; but conditionally, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the event or ſucceſs of the Negotiation, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting as well to be partaker of the loſs as of the gain; but the contract of the free lending binds the Borrower by an abſolute covenant to reſtore the principal; and the contract of Uſury binds the Borrower by an abſolute covenant not only to repay the principal, but alſo to yeeld the overplus covenanted for.</p>
                     <p>So that whether there be a covenant or intent of gain by loan, whether it be in the firſt act of lending, or afterwards in forbearing, it is USURY, ſaith that renowned Biſhop, and contrarywiſe where the is neither a covenant, nor intent of gain in lending, or forbearing, there is no Uſury; tho there be overplus or encreaſe received over and beſides the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal.</p>
                     <p>And this abſolute Covenant (ſaith that renowned B.) is not an abuſe beſides the nature of this contract, as ſome have imagined, but as the abſolute covenant of the reſtitution of the principal is included in the contract of mutuation, ſo the abſolute covenant not only of repaying the principal, but alſo of paying Uſury is included in the contract of actual, or, as they call it formal Uſury: For if there be a covenant only in <hi>eventum lucri,</hi> to gain, if he gain, or have expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gain for loan, without any further covenant, but for the reſtitution of the principal, then is the former not formal Uſury, tho it be mental, and actual in part, and the latter is but mental Uſury and not then neither; if as on the one ſide there is a covenant of partaking gain, if there be gain; ſo on the other ſide, if there be a covenant of partaking loſs, or as there is expectation of gain if the Borrower gain, ſo there be an unfeigned bearing part of the loſs which the<note n="*" place="bottom">

As for my ancient friend <hi>Rivet,</hi> he alſo doth not much croſs me: For I ſhall eaſily grant, that as he ſaith, Chriſt doth not immediately forbid Uſury by this Scripture; but I add that conſequently he doth, as <hi>Beza</hi> alſo, who is greater than <hi>Rivet,</hi> doth averr the ſame, as I have formerly ſhewn.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. So my dear Couſin <hi>Spanhemius</hi> and I do not diſagree ſo much as the Ch. pretends: For he doth not ſay that Uſury is not to be underſtood in that place; but that Chriſt in and by that place would have us to erogate our mony to the poor, when they need it, even them from whom we can have no hope to receive either gain or principal; which ſheweth that he underſtands Chriſt's words of lending properly ſo called, and not of giving properly ſo called. For when a thing is properly given, there can be no looking for either gain or principal: and beſides, if my Couſin <hi>Spanhemius</hi> ſhould confound one with the other as to make lending giving, and giving lending; he cannot evince it by an un undeniable demonſtration, that Chriſt meaneth Alms giving.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Jelinger.</hi> It cannot be underſtood of giving, becauſe giving to the poor is ſpoken of there diſtinctly from lending by Chriſt, who would not uſe a tautology.</p>

                        <hi>Num.</hi> 75. To make this a little more plain, I will add two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Lender can do no other then ſo give away what he lends, and that is to ſay, to make it his for a time to whom he lends it, as for that cauſe its alſo called in latin
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Mutuum quaſi de meo tuum. Sic</hi> Calepinus. <hi>Mutuum dicitur ab eo quod de meo tuum ſit,</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>mutuum,</hi> becauſe of <hi>mine</hi> it becomes <hi>thine,</hi> the reaſon is becauſe if it ſhould not be his, but he ſhould be forced to render the ſame mony in kind, and in the very ſame pieces which he has received, he cannot uſe it at all, ſeeing that by uſing it, he changes it, and puts it away from him: which has cauſed one to ſay, that when mony is delivered to be uſed by a man, its not poſſible that the Deliverer ſhould remain ſtill Lord and Owner of the ſaid ſelf ſame mony.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Lender will no other but give it, that is, alienate it, and make it his to whom its lent, becauſe elſe the danger of looſing would be his; and this is the greateſt ground of Uſury ſaith he, in that men will not hazard at all their principal ſum of mony (otherwiſe perchance they might have more gain, and that lawfully too, in the trade of merchandiſing, either by themſelves or in fellowſhip together with others) but whiles they will by all means be ſure of their principal, and will adventure nothing; they are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of this mind, not to have it loſt, and periſh from them; but will have it made his own mony who borroweth it, (and ſo to give it, as it were, making it a <hi>mutuum quaſi,</hi> as Civilians call a kind of lending, as I ſaid even now) and to have him Debtor not of the very ſame again, but ſo much in quantity, ſo as that Uſurers mony is ſtill ſafe and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not periſh in that reſpect; For no general quantity doth ever periſh, but only the particular things, which are within ſome
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:32640:112"/>certain place, or circumſtance; and has not my Adverſary well gotten by his giving?</p>

                        <hi>Num.</hi> 76. <hi>The ſecond Objection is,</hi> that the Scripture it ſelf calls lending for gain giving in ſeveral places, as namely, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.27. <hi>Thou ſhalt not give him thy money to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury,</hi> and <hi>Pſ.</hi> 15.5.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whereunto I anſwer firſt,</hi> we muſt not be ſo ſimple as to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from thence that the Uſurer practiceth the contract of giving properly ſo called, for as much as he intendeth for the return of every, 100 <abbr>

                        </abbr> and for ſix over and above: So that the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> notably addeth to giving taking, even taking of encreaſe, which ſheweth what a GIVING is meant, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as carrieth taking again with it, and a return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again of the principal with an encreaſe, whereas in giving properly ſo called there is no returning.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> that as the Opponent brings his four Authors, as making againſt me and being for him in the ſenſe of GIVING, ſo I ſhall adduce more then four as able Divines as any of his, which really are for me (whereas his do but ſeem to be ſo) And, 1.

And thus the Greeks, and the Latines, the Jews, the Philoſophers, the Lawyers, the Diviness and generally all the Heathens and Chriſtians take that to be the nature and true definition or diſcription of loan: So that by this his ſaying he makes it to appear that lending here required is not giving, becauſe in giving is nothing repay'd</p>

                  <hi>Object:</hi> 2: Mr. <hi>Jelinger.</hi> The Law againſt Uſurie is <hi>Political,</hi> concerning the <hi>Jews</hi> only and not us, therefore we cannot be condemned for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jelinger,</hi> this is a Fallacy, and the contrary cannot be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proved: Let us ſee his proofs. 1. The Prophets enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Uſurie among the tranſgreſſions of the Moral law, <hi>Ezek:</hi> 18: 8: 15: <hi>Jer:</hi> 15: 10: and ſo doth this <hi>Pſalm</hi> 15: 5: <hi>Reply,</hi> as for <hi>Jer.</hi> 15: 10: It makes little for his purpoſe. <hi>A.</hi> Nor do I make any great matter of it here, but upon an other account
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:32640:140"/>I ſhall make ſomething of it. That which is aſſerted of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. that it contains only Morals, may admit of an uſe of <hi>Addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,</hi> thereby he jeers me; becauſe <hi>I</hi> did in my laſt Book often mention ſuch an Uſe of Addubitation, which I have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from a better man than he is, <hi>Viz.</hi> of that glorious Martyr <hi>Peter Ramus,</hi> who dyed for Chriſt in the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Maſſacre, and hath it in his Works; and there he goeth on, and ſaith, <hi>It ſeemeth to me</hi> there are Judicials and Ceremonials too, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and referred to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> 1. <hi>It ſeems</hi> he ſaith doubtingly. 2. But ſuppoſe it were ſo, there be Scriptures for certain wherein Uſury is placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Morals only, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.7, 8, 9. As Biſhop
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Biſhop Downam upon Plal.</hi> 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Downam</hi> alſo hath obſerved it; ſaying, There remains the laſt Teſtimony if ſuch Exceptions can be taken: For here is no mention made either of the Poor, as if it were committed againſt them alone, or of the detaining a pledge, as if Uſury were matched therewith; for it is matched with murder, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, inceſt, and other ſuch abominations; neither is it in this place, ſo ſubject to oppreſſion, as a ſpecies thereof, but generally and ſimply it is condemned as a grievous abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So then this place will hold it, to ſhew that Uſury is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among moral Evils, to make it ſelf a moral Evil. As for the places by him quoted, <hi>Lev.</hi> 15.14, 18, 35 and 36. and <hi>Acts</hi> 15.29. <hi>to them I have this to ſay.</hi> 1. That he infeebles again what he ſaith, by this <hi>It ſeems.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That as one Sun is ſufficient to give light to the whole World, ſo that one place in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. is ſufficient to give light to all the reſt, to all them that went before, and comes in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a manner, purpoſely to ſhew what a moral Evil it is, being ſo placed among moral Evils only, to take off the Cavils of Uſuries Champions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That his Aſſertion is falſe in <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. wherein Uſury is forbidden, <hi>ver.</hi> 35, 36. placed as he ſaith, in the midſt of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Laws, there are no other Laws mentioned but ſuch in that Chapter. For there are mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. theſe moral Laws, <hi>You ſhall not oppreſs one another, that is one, but thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God, that is another,</hi> and the ſame is repeated to convince this bold and impudent Aſſertor with a Witneſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 43. <hi>Thou ſhalt fear thy God,</hi> and one moral more there is in the ſame verſe: <hi>Thou ſhalt not rule over him</hi> (namely a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant there mentioned) <hi>with rigour;</hi> who therefore can believe a man that will ſay ſo, as he ſaith when it is not ſo; this ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:32640:140"/>cracks a mans credit, and puts men <hi>upon a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Addubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> ſure enough in a matter of ſuch concernment as is the preſent Controverſie; about the Law of Uſury, whether it be Political or Moral.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From that place, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.29. Where Fornication is placed among Ceremonials it doth not therefore follow that as Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is reckoned among Ceremonials, and yet it ſelf is a moral Tranſgreſſion; ſo Uſury may be reckoned among Morals and yet be Political, this I ſay doth not follow. 1. Becauſe theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials there mentioned, were to be obſerved only for a time; as we ſee that they are not now obſerved; becauſe there is no ſuch reaſon for it now as there was then, when the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians lived among the Jews, who were highly offended by ſuch things as are there prohibited for a Seaſon, whereas Uſury is a ſin for ever prohibited, being a moral Tranſgreſſion as has been partly proved, and ſhall by and by yet be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 5. 5. And becauſe he brings his Authors aſſerting the Law of Uſury to be political, as <hi>Calvin, Hughes, Rivet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I'le alledge Authors too, and I trow a goodly company of Famous and Learned Men indeed: <hi>Viz.</hi> Beſides Doctor <hi>Fenton</hi> and the many famous Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, Gregory Niſcene, Ambroſe, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Auſtin, Hieronimus, Thomas Aquinas, Peter Lombard, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius, Carthuſianus, Gabriel Biel, Lyra, Rainerus, Aquileius, Luther, Melanchton, Brentius, Muſculus, Themnitius, Aretius, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingius, VVigandius, Zegedinns, Molarcus, Viguerius, VVolvius,</hi> (and many more) to which names formerly named, I ſhall add the Names and very Words of many more very worthy men; as namely Mr. <hi>Moſs</hi> firſt, who ſaith in his conviction of Uſury, <hi>I ſee no reaſon why thoſe precepts of</hi> Moſes <hi>concerning <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould not be reckoned among the judicial, and not amongſt the moral Laws; for ſure I am moſt learned men of all Ages, and of all kinds have numbred them among the morals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>Powel</hi> frames this ſyllogiſm for the morality of the Law againſt Vſury, in <hi>Barbara,</hi> from <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.25. <hi>You ſhall not oppreſs him with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury, Oppreſſion is a breach of the moral Law; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:32640:141"/>among the greateſt of Evils, therefore it muſt needs of it ſelf be a Moral Evil, and a great one too; with which Authors I joyn the learned <hi>Capel</hi> in the

               <p n="5">5. And now to anſwer his Authors, what are thoſe few to ſo many, ſay I, as was ſaid of the <hi>Loaves,</hi> what are theſe few among ſo many: He names 3. <hi>or</hi> 4. and I name 29. and could name many more, and how inconſiderable is their authority all things conſidered. For to begin with <hi>Rivet.</hi> He tells what might be the cauſes why the <hi>Jews</hi> might not lend to their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren upon Uſurie, but proves it not that they were the cauſes, and beſides Chriſt in the 6, of <hi>Luke</hi> 35. Overthrows all that he ſaith, and <hi>Hughes</hi> ſaith, and <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith. But a little more of Mr. <hi>Hughes</hi> firſt that he was too ſhort in ſo great a matter, and wants Scripture for what he ſaith; and 2. I know the time (for we were Miniſters together in one and the ſame Pariſh) when he was bitter enough againſt Uſury, and others there are who can tell and ſatisfie, how he kept them from the Lords Supper for Uſurie.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Calvin,</hi> I confeſs he was a glorious Sun in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts Church, and one whom I admire and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as much as any one Proteſtant writer; but this muſt be confeſſed withall, that he is but a man, and therefore may err as well as other men, and doth err in the Doctrine of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<note n="†" place="bottom">Calvin. <hi>Epiſt. reſponſ. de Vſuris.</hi>
                  </note> Sabbath; and therefore is to be commended for this, that <hi>in the Doctrine of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurie, holding it to be forbidden by a political law, he would have no man take his Opinion for an Edict; as his words do declare it, whereby he requireth that no man ſhould ſtand upon his judgment for a full and abſolute Determination of this Controverſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereupon a great Author makes this Inference; that unjuſtly</hi> Mr. Calvin <hi>is cited as a Patron of their unlawful party.</hi> So that I have no reaſon or cauſe to be of his Judgement, whileſt he himſelf would not have me ſtick to it. <hi>Rivet</hi> is alſo for me;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:32640:141"/>for he is againſt Injury in the place by the Champion quoted; and ſo am I, and ſo againſt Uſurie, which is an Injury.</p>
               <p n="6">6: And why ſhould not the Laws of Uſurie be reputed for Moral, as well as thoſe which concern inceſt, of which no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ever doubted but that they ought to abide perpetual as precepts of the Moral law? For if it be objected that the laws of Uſurie have received ſome exceptions (whereof hereafter) it is moſt evident that the laws of Inceſt have received excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and diſpenſations too.

And firſt, That, tho in places by him na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, expreſs mention is made of the poor, yet in others (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.15.) as namely in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.8. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.12. and <hi>Luke</hi> 6.35. there is noted.</p>

                  <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> have a law, as I ſaid once already, that the lender ſhall take no Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, making no exception of the poor at all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And why ſhould thoſe places which mention the poor rather reſtrain the other which make mention of them, than the other, which make no mention of them ſhould enlarge them which name them, eſpecially if we conſider, that thoſe places which mention not the poor were the latter written, and that Divines have a Rule; which ſaith, that latter books were written ſomewhat to this purpoſe, that they might be Interpreters and Expoſitors of the former.</p>
               <p>Where Note, how I go to work to ſtop gaps and mouths by this rule, and by an obſervation of mine too, that the <hi>Pſalms</hi> and ſo the 15. and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> eſpecially <hi>thoſe</hi> 2. and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 6.35.

               <p n="4">4, I ſay farther, that there is great reaſon for it, why there ſhould be ſo often mention made of the poor; becauſe 1.

As for his aſſertion that the Law not only permits and tollerates, but allows Uſury, becauſe men may recover the uſe that Laws preſcribe; <hi>I anſwer,</hi> that it cannot be an allowance, becauſe the Title of the Law is, <hi>An Act againſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury,</hi> which is ſeconded by <hi>Beza,</hi> ſaying as I ſaid once already.

               <p n="2">2: I anſwer, That the uſe of mony is not to be recovered by Law, as Uſe; but as a debt upon another account: wherefore it is, that the Vſurer has his Uſe added to the Principal, for which thing he is highly condemned by Authors.</p>
               <p>The third fault in Vſurers is, ſaith one, <q rend="margQuotes">When to avoid the penalty of the Law, they colour the matter in that they write in their Bills of debt, one to have borrowed ſo much of them, when it is not ſo much: And again he ſaith, There can be no obligation of Vſury, no not ſo much as by the Civil Law in the contract of Lending; and Vſury cannot be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by force of lending,

                  <hi>Num.</hi> 43. And becauſe ſome will hardly believe it, that the Law does not allow of Vſury, I will once more recite two Acts of Parliament, <hi>viz. Jacobi</hi> 21. An Act againſt Vſury, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that no words in this Law contained ſhall be conſtrued or expounded to allow the practice of Vſury in point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or Conſcience a dreadful Thunderbolt from a moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ring, and a wiſe Parliament. 2. And <hi>Eliz.</hi> 13. Foraſmuch as all Vſury being forbidden by the word of God, is ſin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſiable, O ſad again! that that worthy Parliament alſo ſhould
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:32640:163"/>prove ſuch a bitter enemy to the poor Vſurer! but ſo it is, who can help it?</p>
               <p n="6">6: I ſay that a ſimple conſtruction it is, that ſome weak de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants of Vſury do make of thoſe words, (as Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it) all Vſury, which is forbidden by the Word of God, when the Law never ſaid ſo, <hi>but being forbidden by the Law of God;</hi> which ſhews what ſimpletons they are ſeveral of them, who defend weakly guarded Vſury.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And becauſe ſome will ſay, why then doth the Law tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate Vſury, if it be the damning ſin of ſo many millions of Souls? I anſwer, 1. That therefore it will not own the practice of it in point of Conſcience, as it ſaith. Nor 2. Does it more than <hi>Moſes</hi> did in the caſe of Divorces, which Divines inſtance in, and <hi>Beza</hi> by name, clearing Godly Magiſtrates in this thing thus; <hi>by reaſon of the wickedneſs of men, they are compelled only to moderate</hi> (mark <hi>moderate,</hi> not allow or defend) <hi>many things elſe, and then adding, as in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury, which many Magiſtrates are compelled to permit, becauſe they ſee that it cannot be utterly aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>

               <p n="8">8. And foraſmuch as ſome think that the Law allows of Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe if a man takes but ſix of the hundred, the Law has nothing to ſay againſt him; <hi>I anſwer,</hi> that it doth not follow from that, that it allows of Vſury, becauſe it condemns all Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as ſin and deteſtable, but only this may be ſaid, and is ſaid by great Divines about it, that it remits the puniſhment which is to be inflicted on ſuch as take more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yea ſo far is the Law from allowing, and favouring Vſury in the leaſt, as that if an Vſurer offend but in the leaſt clauſe of the Law, he is puniſhed for it: As for example, if he take his mony but a day before it is due, he ſuffers for it upon complaint made; ſo if he taketh any thing above the ſtint.

Only this I will ſuper-add, that the Seller may ſell the dearer for giving ſo long time as a year is, yet he muſt not ſell too dear, for there is a conſcience to be made of all ſuch things; becauſe we muſt not wrong one another in bargaining. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.5.6.</p>

                  <hi>I anſwer,</hi> 1. Who be they that have pleaded for it?

               <p n="2">2. Nor is it to be proved by <hi>Grotius</hi> ſubſtantially, that <hi>Leo</hi> was the firſt Emperour that did forbid all Uſury, and that the firſt Chriſtians did practiſe Uſury for four in the hundred; for I have proved the contrary before now by ſubſtantial Authors, <hi>viz.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> and <hi>Alex. ab Alex.</hi> and others, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Caius</hi> did put down Uſury before <hi>Leo,</hi> yea by <hi>Luther</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, how the very firſt Emperour <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was againſt U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and proved how the firſt Chriſtians did not at all practiſe it; ſo then I leave it to true Engliſh Hearts to chuſe, whether they will believe their own Engliſh Divines, Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Downam,</hi> and ſuch like; or this Stranger <hi>Grotius.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. This Champion having beaten, overcome, and confuted, as he ſuppoſeth, renowned Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> thinks to beat Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> too, out of <hi>Mars</hi> field, by ſeveral aſſaults made upon him which ſheweth his peremptorineſs, ſawcineſs, and impudence, yet more abundantly, that he will offer to confute ſuch a great famous man as Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> was, who as one ſaid, was able to keep a better man than he to wait upon him, and whom King <hi>James</hi> ſent to the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> againſt the Remonſtrants, and whoſe moſt excellent Books have been tranſlated partly into Dutch, as upon my knowledge I told him, and partly into French, as one born in <hi>France</hi> lately informed me.</p>
               <p>So that if that moſt pious and learned Man were now alive, he would diſdain to anſwer ſuch a Novice, which makes me to do here as in bleſſed <hi>Bolton</hi>'s caſe, for I do not ſee how I can preſume to defend ſuch an able Biſhop, who has fought ſo well for himſelf againſt his Adverſaries when he lived, and in this matter of Uſury has done ſo well, and therefore is well able to defend himſelf without my poor help, his words being of that weight, as that of themſelves they are able to defend themſelves, and being ſeconded alſo by what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> of old, and Biſhop <hi>Downam,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sanders</hi> of late, have written to the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply,</hi> 1. It could not be expected that men lately come out of Popery, ſhould on a ſudden ſhake off all the errors held in that Church, <hi>&amp;c:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf became more moderate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereunto I anſwer,</hi> 1. As he leaves out the words of that Univerſities <hi>Theſes</hi> or Poſitions, becauſe they do extremely make againſt him, ſo ſhall I leave out the many words which
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:32640:168"/>he uſeth here, and <hi>Rivet</hi> too, becauſe they cited in Latin, and ſo I will only 1. Shew the occaſion of thoſe <hi>Wittemburg</hi> Poſitions again Vſury ſo famouſly known; as I have it of a certain German
<note n="*" place="bottom">Philip Caeſar.</note> Divine, who lived neer <hi>Wittemburg</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> and informs me by his writing againſt Vſury; that the ſaid <hi>Theſes</hi> were affixed in <hi>Wittemburg,</hi> diſputed and approved when <hi>Mordeſius</hi> proceeded Doctor in Divinity, and that <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf was a ſtrong condemner of Vſury.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I will refel what he ſaith that it could not be expected, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after this manner: When <hi>Luther</hi> had ſet up his poſitions againſt the Popes Indulgence, ſpread by <hi>Terdius,</hi> then <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> ſet forth his <hi>Theſes</hi> againſt Vſury at <hi>Wittemburg,</hi> that both Popery and Vſury might fall together: And to let men ſee that it was not only in the beginning of the Reformation, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward alſo, and ever ſince to our preſent time, the ableſt Wits and holieſt of men, both Miniſters and Writers, have with one voice cryed down that loud crying ſin of Vſury. So that it is a mere and vain boaſt that moſt modern Divines, Lawyers, and Moraliſts have received the opinion favouring moderate Vſury; for all that which thoſe Divines ſo much talked of, I do ſay is, that men muſt uſe ſuch and ſuch cautions, which are eight or nine, and make that which ſome call Vſury no Vſury, whereupon what he ſaith of <hi>Geſner</hi> and <hi>Windelin,</hi> Profeſſor of the School (not Vniverſity) of <hi>Anhalt</hi> and of
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Which pious and renowned</hi> Polanus <hi>left being infected with dangero is Tenents, as</hi> Clerk <hi>relates it.</hi>

And becauſe twice in his Pamphlet he tells of <hi>Luther,</hi> that at laſt he became more moderate, he muſt prove ſubſtantially, which will be a hard task for him to do: For other great Divines make light of it, and Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> eſpecially, and one more; ſo that ſtill he is quoted by all Antiuſurarians as a bitter enemy to Vſury, which would be very injurious to him, if he had recanted.</p>

                  <hi>I anſwer,</hi> 1. How can he be as one of them, who even now called the Papiſts our Adverſaries, though not in the doctrine of Uſury, wherein we agree as we do in the Doctrine of the Trinity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for that which my Friend Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> tells of the Popes publick banks, and of <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Maldonate,</hi> that they ſpeak as much in effect as the Calviniſts; what is that to me, who know what limitations and cautions they have, and how they are for money given as an inſtrument of <hi>Negotiation?</hi> Mark that, as <hi>Maldonate</hi> ſpeaks, and that they are for damage, as <hi>Scotus</hi> ſaith, but not for uſe.</p>

I am not bound to juſtifie all that any holds or writes, concerning Uſury; if he defends what is true, I aſſent, and am for that truth, if not, I leave him; as alſo then I do when Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts defend Theft in any perſon, or any ſin committed with the eye, or any other evil, as many ſuch things one may meet with in <hi>Tolet</hi> and in the <hi>Enchiridium</hi> of <hi>Navarra,</hi> and in <hi>Sa, Filiutius,</hi> and <hi>Eſtobar,</hi> Jeſuits.</p>

               <p>But 3. I will ſay a little more of that which he ſpeaks but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of. Will thoſe few Divines bear you out before Chriſts Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal? <hi>viz.</hi> 1: That I ſay ſo, becauſe they will leave him there

               <p>
                  <hi>Alas poor Soul, whither wilt thou turn thy ſelf for ſuccour, when thy friends forſake thee? What wilt thou plead for thy ſelf when thou comeſt before the Eternal Judge upon thy Trial?</hi> This methinks ſhould make the Champion's and every Uſurers heart to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As for his ſaying, that the practice of his regulated Uſury is under the allowance of publick laws; to that I have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed formerly proving the contrary, whereunto I will now add again the ſaying of the foreſaid great Dr. <hi>Fenton, viz. An abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute contract for</hi> 10, 9, 8, or 6, <hi>in the</hi> 100, <hi>is without warrant or Authority even among thoſe Divines which have moſt favourably concluded for thee: Obſerve</hi> 6 <hi>in the</hi> 100.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To his additions, theſe be ſome of his men, ſome bad Papiſts he means, which will riſe in judgment againſt our Uſurers. <hi>I anſwer,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He wrongs me if he ſays that theſe be the only men which I mean, when I ſay that they would riſe in judgment againſt the Uſurers: No verily, I do not honour thoſe men ſo much who are very ſcrupulous in the matter of Uſury, and yet are for Whoredom and other grievous ſins; but I mean thoſe Schoolmen, Canoniſts, Caſuiſts, and learned Doctors, which are both againſt all Uſury and all other vices too, will riſe in Judgment.</p>

                  <hi>Num,</hi> 7. But I ſee this Adverſary would have me anſwer to thirteen Queſtions, to which bold and ſawcy propoſal I ſhall ſay thus much.</p>
               <p>That as Chriſt ſaid once when he was asked, <hi>By what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doſt thou theſe things? Matth.</hi> 21.23.24. So I will aſk him but five Queſtions alſo, to which if he anſwer me ſolidly, I will anſwer ſuch of his queſtions as are worth the anſwering next, thinking it neceſſary and fit to anſwer but one of the thirteen now.</p>
               <p>The Firſt of my Queſtions is, How this Champion can juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the putting out of his money upon Uſury, without any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of any expreſs Scripture, making it lawful for him ſo to do?</p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:32640:176"/>
               <p>The Second Queſtion is, Whether he have ever made any reſtitution of all the mony which he has taken for the uſe and loan of his money, ſince he firſt began to be a lender upon U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury?</p>
               <p>The Third Queſtion, Whether his Conſcience doth not check and ſmite him, when he receives his Uſury Money of ſuch and ſuch? He knows whom I mean.</p>
               <p>The Fourth Queſtion, By what Scripture he will prove the lawfulneſs of his moderate Uſury by him maintained? Seeing that not only <hi>Neſheck,</hi> biring, but <hi>Tarbith,</hi> that is any increaſe, is by the word of God forbidden as a ſin, as a Great Parliament of <hi>England</hi> declares it, ſaying: <hi>That all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury being forbidden by the word of God, is ſin and deteſtable, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fifth Queſtion, Whether he that does not obſerve the godly cautions preſcribed by godly Divines, may be excuſed and eſcape in that great day, by <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. <hi>In many things we offend all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for that one Queſtion,</hi> which at preſent I will only anſwer, is the very firſt.</p>
               <p>Whether I have made reſtitution of three pounds for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney put into a Tradeſmans hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereunto I anſwer,</hi> That I have no need to make ſuch reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe I never lent to a Tradeſman or any man elſe in the whole world, any money upon Uſury; God is my witneſs, let any prove it if they can. I add, that this hath been ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſifted already by thoſe which have heard of it, for I have proffered before many witneſſes to a perſon which gave out ſuch a report, a great ſum of money, if he could make it appear that ever I lent to any perſon upon Uſury in all my life, but it could never yet be proved.</p>
               <p>And no new thing it is for the Servants of God to be ſo uſed, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> for Writing againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> was accuſed and charged with murther and uncleanneſs: <hi>Calvin</hi> for Writing and ſtanding againſt Popery had a Book written againſt him by <hi>Bolſecus</hi> an Apoſtate, charging him with Sodomy. So <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in his life time had moſt hainous things laid to his charge in Print; and one of the Champions Friends whom I forbear to name, and Mr. <hi>Moſs,</hi> for writing againſt Uſury, was ſaid to be an Uſurer himſelf, as he writes himſelf: Yea <hi>Nehemiah</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who was ſuch a notable enemy to all Uſury, has been made an Uſurer himſelf by ſome Vſurers Tranſlations, as out of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Downam</hi> I have proved it: So that no wonder it is that <hi>Satan</hi> that old Lyar, playeth his old Game of Lying againſt me the leaſt of all Gods ſlandered, belied, reviled Servants al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, after my laborious Writing and ſetting my ſelf againſt his
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:32640:177"/>great Idol, which he has ſet up in the World, Vſury I mean, the Vſurers Great <hi>Diana,</hi> but confident I am, that my God, whoſe Truth I am vindicating, will deliver me and clear mine innocency gratiouſly, To whom alone be all Honour and Glory.</p>

<note n="*" place="bottom">Which cauſed a famous Writer to ſay, we Miniſters are to be blamed for many of the exorbitancies of our people, becauſe of our example we harden them in their ſin.</note> becauſe by their practice and example, ſo many thouſand Souls are led and drawn down to hell, when they ſee them which ſhould ſhew them the way to Heaven and Salvation,

For what do they ſay when I and others do Preach and Print againſt that odious ſin? If Vſury were ſuch a damnable ſin as ſome make it, ſuch and ſuch a Miniſter (naming thee that art a lender upon Vſury, by thy very name) would not lend his money after that manner. Whereupon, ſaith one, I know where he lends ſo much to ſuch a one, who pays him according to the uſual rate; nay ſaith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, I had hundreds of ſuch a Miniſter, and becauſe I paid but five in the hundred, he vvas not contented becauſe I paid not ſix, when of another, who though he vvas a Vſurer too, yet let me have it for three in the hundred. Thus they talk of Miniſters, vvhich cauſed a Godly Miniſter in diſcourſing vvith me about it, to ſay to me, that he did ever hate Vſury, and would not take any though never ſo little, if he might gain the World, becauſe of the bad example which a Miniſter gives to others: And again he ſaid, Many of our Miniſters now turn Vſurers, and their Hearers turn after them, making that the cauſe of it, why there are ſo many Vſurers now; whereas ſome years ago, men counted Vſury to be ſo odious a thing as that few would venture upon it.</p>

               <p>I am the more earneſt in this, becauſe Prieſts and Clergy men in all Ages have been ever ſpoken againſt and cenſured for Uſury, if they were guilty of it; it being thought to be a thing above all other men, moſt unbeſeeming and unbecoming them: I will inſtance only,</p>

               <p>Whereunto he added, Pardon me for uſing this expreſſion, it was his own when he lived, that he could never abide it, and therefore he never lent any of his money upon Uſury: For the certainty of which remarkable Report, I did ask the Preacher himſelf being in his Company very lately, and he owned it; ſo that I ſay again, that to be hoped it is, that more Miniſters will follow, which that it may prove ſo, is the prayer of him that has written theſe Lines; wiſhing that he might write them with his Blood and <hi>not with Ink,</hi> if it would pleaſe God, and he might do any poor Soul good thereby, and free it from that bloody ſin of Uſury, called Murder, even by <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf and many others. And wiſhing farther, that the Great God, which hates and forbids both <hi>Neſheck</hi> and <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith,</hi> Vſury and all Increaſe, would be pleaſed to write the ſame which is written in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.19. and hereto, with his own Finger as with the Pen of a Diamond, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.1. in mens hearts, putting the point of it upon their hearts, and eſpecially the hearts of thoſe that practice Vſury and defend it, their hearts being made truly penitent and deeply ſenſible by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that being diſſwaded they may <hi>wholly forbear all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury,</hi> as himſelf would have them to do, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.8.</p>
               <p>Moſt Great God, <hi>Fulfil this thy Servants Vote, and hear him graciouſly, for the ſake of thy Son, who is alſo againſt that mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind of lending, called <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury, ſaying: Lend freely, hoping for nothing from thence,</hi> Luke 6.35. Amen, So be it.</p>
               <p>And ſo I have done with Miniſters firſt.</p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:32640:179"/>
               <p n="2">2. AND You, Gentlemen, whatſoever you do, do not put your money to uſury; for you have Eſtates to live by comfortably, and if that which you have be not enough, you may buy more, and you have no need at all to live by V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, as many others plead that they muſt, becauſe they have no Lands, but Moneys only to employ for their maintenance. Oh that you would hearken unto me in this! Oh that you would do as other great ones, even Heathens have done, thoſe great Emperours <hi>Tiberius</hi> and others I mean, who would rather lend freely to others to prevent Vſurers, than to be Vſurers themſelves.</p>
               <p>Oh let not theſe Heathens riſe up in Judgment againſt you.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Nor let them for whom he takes ſuch ſpecial care by his Providence, be ſo ungracious and ungrateful as to miſtruſt him, that he will not provide lawful ways and means for them, whereby their portion and moneys may be employed for their maintenance, and ſupport, and let them not provide for themſelves Vſury
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:32640:179"/>Bags, therein to put their Uſury money for their ſuſtenance, for fear leſt they put it in Bags that have holes; and will not hold their diſhoneſt gain long; God ſmiring at it with his fiſt, as he has menaced it, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22: 13. and ſo their money pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and they too with it for ever.</p>
               <p>I add, Orphans are coming into the world, Widows, who intend to continue, are looked upon as going out of the world, and ſhall theſe two Ages which above all other ought to be made heavenly, the one for Innocency, the other for Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be ſtained with Uſury? Chriſt is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> unto us, the firſt and the laſt, the beginning and the end; and ſhall the <hi>Alpha</hi> of our Nonage, and the <hi>Omega</hi> of our Dotage, be dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Uſury?

And will our Widows be tinctured ſo too? God forbid.</p>
               <p>O that poor Orphans and Fatherleſs Children would all do as ſome of them have promiſed me, that they would leave that filthy ſin of Uſury from henceforth, being convinced by my <hi>

               </p>
               <p>And let this be minded by you too, what hurt you do to many other poor Souls by your practice: For what do they ſay of you? If Uſury were ſo bad as ſome make it, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of ſuch and ſuch, who I am ſure have as good Souls to God, as thoſe which prate and preach ſo much againſt it?</p>
               <p>Ah poor Profeſſors, you did not think upon this it may be heretofore, but now give your minds to it, and ſay as

And ſo though ignorant and ſilly creatures do offend in this kind of harm, by bringing one another into the ſame condemnation by their example, yet do not you ſo go to Hell with thoſe whom they draw to bear them company.</p>
               <p>Again, Let this be thought upon by ye, my Brethren, that if you ſhall refuſe to leave and ſhun that filthy ſin of Uſury, you will make all men that know you to live in that ſin, ſay of you, that you have but a form of Godlineſs, and deny the power thereof, as it is ſaid that ſome ſhall do in the latter days, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Becauſe no truly pious man will defile himſelf</hi> (as ſaith <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>Deliro,</hi> a noted Interpreter of the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:32640:190"/>Scripture, and after him, the Author of the <hi>Holy Court,</hi> relate both, the Viſion of a Wiſe man, who on a day ſought for the Court, or Houſe of Conſcience; and it ſeemed to him, he beheld a City built with goodly Architecture, beautiful with five Gates, which had as many narrow paths, ending in one large way: Upon this way ſtood a Regiſter, who took the Names of all paſſengers to record them: Beyond that, he ſaw two Tribunes attended with a great concourſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, who governed the inferior parts of the City: Above was beheld a Cittadel, wherein a great Princeſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, who had a Scepter in her hand, and Crown on her head: By her ſide was a Lady very ancient and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, who in one hand held a torch, wherewith ſhe lighted the Princeſs; and in the other a goad, wherewith ſhe prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, if ſhe governed not according to her diſcretion. The wiſe man amazed, asked in his heart, what all this meant? and he heard a voice within, which ſaid unto him, Behold, Thy ſelf, ere thou art aware, art arrived at the Houſe (or Court) of Conſcience, which thou ſoughteſt for. The five gates which thou ſaweſt, are the five ſenſes. The way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they all meet, is common ſenſe. All the people which thou ſaweſt enter in by heaps, are the objects of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the world, which firſt touch our ſenſes, before they paſs into the Soul. The Regiſter is Imagination, that keepeth record of all things. The two Tribunes are the two Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites; the one called the Appetite of Concupiſcence; the other the appetite of Anger, extreamly ſtriving to oppoſe all obſtacles which oppoſe its good, real, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. This Maſs of people are the paſſions, which make ill work in the inferiour parts of the City. The Princeſs in the Cittadel with a Crown and Scepter, is Reaſon. The ancient Lady by her ſide is Conſcience. She hath a torch to ſhew the good way, and the goad to prick thoſe that wander: all which I apply thus: Anſwerable hereunto, I ſay to the Courteous Reader, who ſhall read this Table, and happily never was yet at this Court of Conſcience here deſcribed, and at this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination here <hi>preſcribed;</hi> and ſo, juſt ſo art thou ere thou waſt aware, arrived at the Houſe or Court of Conſcience; and therefore being thus entred into it, examine thy ſelf, according to this Examination-Table, and according to the Order of the Court of Conſcience here deſcribed, lying low <hi>in thy very ſhame,</hi> as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 2.26. Before the Lord; and yet, ſitting withall like a Judge upon thy ſelf, according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. For this ſitting and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:32640:191"/>ſelf-judging, and ſelf-examining, this Court permitteth, and no other beſides it. And that thou mayeſt do it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectualy and ſucceſsfully, is the moſt hearty prayer of thy moſt affectionate Friend, who hath penned theſe lines for thee, and who, when they dropped from his pen, beſought God in thy behalf that the ſame may be written by himſelf in thy very heart, <hi>as with a pen of a Diamond,</hi> Jer. 17.1. And that as Juſtice ſits in the foreſaid Court of Conſcience, and even of thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, inſcribing all thy ſins, ſo Mercy may ſit by her, blotting out all that Juſtice hath therein written, putting the point of its pen upon thy tender heart, it being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come truly penitent by its ſelf-judging and ſelf-examining, and Gods bleſſing and mighty working going with it.

               <p>THE 1. Inſtruction is, Be much with God in Praying, and praiſing. (1) in praying and as it were all prayer, as <hi>David</hi> was, who ſaith in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.4. <hi>I am Prayer,</hi> that is to ſay, be praying as Gods Elect, even day and night, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.7, 8.

He roſe a Great while before day, and prayed; For then none can hinder me, and then I ſhall have time enough, to performe all my Noctural Exerciſes, and to get an anſwer by craving a token for good, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 86.7. Which to me commonly is Triumphant ſhedding of leaves, which in ſuch ſolemne praying I ſeldome miſſe, and to Gods Glory here do mention that others may do ſo to; and glorifie God thereupon, becauſe that aſſureth them that their Prayers
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:32640:192"/>are heard, I add; that after ſuch praying, we ſhould ſtill lay up ſomething in ſtore for the poor Saints according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.9. And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. And St. <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſtomes</hi> pious Adviſement.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In praiſing God; for how full are <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms of ſuch praiſing, <hi>viz. Pſal.</hi> 92.95.96.98.110.150. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo alſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.

For which end I have learned ſundry of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms by heart, that in the dark I may ſing them like <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Act.</hi> 16. to the praiſe of my Maker, as well as when it is light, which I intend to do as long as I live; and ſo till I enter ternity there to ſing the Songs of <hi>Zion</hi> to all Eternity; and I have read of an Eminently holy man, which ſcarce had his like in the time wherein he flouriſhed, that moſt of his work was Singing of Praiſes, and that, when he was near his end he cryed out, bring the Bible, and let us, ſing the Pſalms of <hi>David;</hi> and that, when he came to Halelujah, he doubled and trebled it, yea four or five times he would ſay it, and that when he did ſing, the Angels would ſing too by his Bed-ſide in the Chamber, which made him cry out I hear the Angels ſing, and after a few hours are over, I ſhall ſtand in Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and ſing the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the Lamb, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable whereunto, I alſo, who am but duſt and aſhes, yet hope, that I ſhall ſhortly, becauſe I am grown Ancient, ſing alſo with that multitude of ſingers which now ſing in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their Song, which is Hallelujah, praiſe the Lord our God, all ye his Servants both ſmall and great, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.5. and my moſt hearty wiſh is that all my Readers may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſing ſo here as that holy man did, that they alſo may hear the Angels ſing, if God think it fit, as he, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for him St. <hi>Jerome</hi> did, who calls God to witneſs, that he heard the Angels ſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Meditate Night and day, according to <hi>Joſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. and eſpecially, upon Eternity as <hi>Paul</hi> was wont to do 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. For Oh how that will keep you from ſinning againſt God; I for my part do uſe my ſelf to this Meditation, very much; if there were a law made, that whoſoever ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate and commit the ſin of Adultery or be drunk or ſwear an Oath, or ſteal, or lie, ſhall lie upon burning Coals for an hours ſpace, and ſo be roaſted like <hi>Laurentius,</hi> who

O dreadful! for this Eternity is ſuch, as that it exceedeth all number, numbring and numbred, ſo called by the Learned; and that after the damned wretches have layen in that formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and tremendous fire ſo many Millions of years as there are leaves upon all the Trees in the world, Haires upon all mens heads, Piles of graſs in all fields, duſt upon the whole ſurface of the earth, ſands on the Sea ſhore, it may and will even then be ſaid, now Eternity beginneth! now Eternity beginneth! and therefore who ſhould not beware of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and all ſuch like tranſgreſſions! O mind the fire ſtill.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let your eyes be Doves eyes! <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.12. They write that Doves love to look into Chriſtaline Rivers, becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them they eſpie their mortal Enemie the Kite, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade him, ſemblably whereunto do you ſo look into the holy Scriptures and read you three Chapters a day, that thereby you may ſee and eſcape your mortal Enemy the Divel and his ſnares, which he laieth over all the world, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. but be ſure to turn all your Chapters into Prayer, which will mightily help you in Praying, and the worlds and ſins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt in your fighting againſt both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Be much in Love with God <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. and with his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. I have read of one, that he was ſo in love with Chriſt: as that he would cry out, he hath Raviſhed me with his Beauty; Oh how glorious is the bleſſed Jeſus! Oh what ſhall I do to ſpeak the hundereth part of his praiſe! Oh he is ſweet! he is altogether Lovely, O for words, O how Glorious, How Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius is this pretious Jeſus! Ah he is ſweet, he is ſweet, and now I am ſick of Love, and ſhall die ſick of Love, ſee <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. Thus he, and oh that all my Readers would be ſo taken too with this moſt fair, moſt ſweet and pretious Jeſus! be in faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings often, as <hi>Paul</hi> was 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. But I will not preſs you with Holy <hi>Calvines</hi> example; who faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his dinner ten yeares together, ſpending his time in Holy Exerciſes, ſo as that even a Jeſuite calls him a great Faſter, it will be well for you, if you can Faſt once a week, which I deſire to do, if God help me, till death; let your talk be of Heaven and Heavenly things as Chriſts was, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.13. After whom I will name <hi>Ignatius Jordan,</hi> who would Alwaies be ſpeaking of Heaven too, and with him I will Joyne an other moſt eminent Servant of God, who would talk as
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:32640:193"/>if he were in the third Heaven, thus did the Holy men talk, and ſo do you, and if you can meet no body to talk with, then talk with your beloved, Chriſt, I meane, as his Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles;</hi> Walking with him Arm in Arm as it were, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the feilds as <hi>Iſack, Gen.</hi> 24.33. or in your Chambers, yea in Heaven it ſelf (mentally) where his Celeſtial Galleries and Walking places be, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.5. which ſweet exerciſe I alſo deſire to uſe daily for my delight, going as it were upon the Streets of Gold above, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.21. When I walk on the Streets of a City or Town to avoid the wandrings of my mind, and I wiſh alſo that all the Saints of God would do ſo, as alſo holy <hi>Fulgentius</hi> did.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Be much for Celeſtial viſits, for Oh how pleaſant they be! when the day Star from on high do viſits us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.79. Where give me leave to give you the words of a ſo viſited gratious Soul; O Friends, ſtand by, and wonder, was there ever ſuch kindneſs ſhewn and ſuch manifeſtationss of rich grace made: Chriſts Armor and kiſſes and ſmiles turn Hell into Heaven: Oh he is come, he is come, and how ſweet is the Bleſſed Jeſus.!</p>
               <p n="8">8. Be as ſtrict, as preciſe, as pure, as Seraphical ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Redeemers of your time as you can poſſibly be, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15.16. 1 10.3.5. where let me add theſe two Councils, (1) Live as you will wiſh you had lived when you come to die, (2.) Leave ſuch and ſuch ſins, as you ſhall wiſh you had left when you muſt leave the world.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Whatſoever you do for God, do it with all your might, and with all ſpeed, as ſome Tranſlators read the Hebrew, in <hi>Ecclef.</hi> 9.10. becauſe there is no working in the Grave unto which we are all going.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Labour to be alwayes ready to depart, by waiting for your change till it cometh, according to <hi>Job.</hi> 14.44. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.44. That is to ſay, from hour to hour, which both places do import, which makes me ſo to inſiſt upon ſuch an hourly preparing for death, becauſe we know not what hour the Son of man will come, by death or Judgment, ſo as that I deſire to put my ſelf alſo upon the practice of it daily, as one that looks for his change hourly, and dares not promiſe himſelf one next day after the preſent, where give me leave to joyne with my ſelf, 3. Noted men more and, 1. <hi>Meſſodamus</hi> who as <hi>Guido Bituricenſis</hi> reports it, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to a Dinner for the next day, returned this Anſwer, I never promiſed my ſelf a next day, looking for my change every hour. The ſecond is <hi>Ignatius Jorden</hi> who, when he went from home, took his leave of his Wife ſtill, as if he
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:32640:193"/>ſhould never return to her again. The third is Mr. <hi>Janewa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> who when he went to his bed, took leave of his friends every evening, hoping to ſee them no more till the morning of his Reſurection! and Oh that all my Readers would be ſuch waiters and preparers too!</p>
               <p>Omit nothing of all things here mentioned, and which God will have done beſides, and the imitation of Chriſt by Name; which is grounded upon <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.5. So that I for my part am exeedingly for the not omitting, and ſo much the more, ſince I read the dreadful ſaying of bleſſed <hi>Ambroſe; a ſlight neglect becomes an everlaſting loſs:</hi> So as that I dare not omit the practice of that famous ſaying of that ſweet Singer of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which I uſe every night, as I awake out of my firſt ſleep; whan I awake I am ſtill with thee, or as the Hebrew alſo will bear it, I will be ſtill with thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.18. And I muſt even marry my ſelf anew to Chriſt, becauſe I do dayly break Wedlock with him, and he bids me to return to him again, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1. Which makes me then ſay, I will return to my firſt Husband, for then it was better with me than now it is, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> Nor can I leave undone any of my other Nocturnal exerciſes, but muſt alſo feed by Faith upon the bread of life, which is my Saviour Chriſt, both for my delight and ſtrengthning, that I may be able to go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſo much as I have to do: Which makes me cry out with that good People; Lord, evermore give me that bread, and a mouth to eat it, even the mouth of faith I humbly pray thee, <hi>John</hi> 6.34. And becauſe I do ſtill meet with Enemies and Oppoſitions, I muſt needs fight alſo and wreſtle with ſin and Sathan, having before wreſtled with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24. with <hi>Eph.</hi> 16.11, 12. And I muſt even aſcend into Heaven it ſelf, and there ſit down in thoſe heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus, as the holy Epheſians did in their time, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.6. And cry out again, Lord Jeſus, make me alſo even now to ſit down in thoſe Heavenly places as thou madeſt the Epheſians ſit—and not being contented with this, I muſt cry again with <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhew me thy glory. <hi>Exo.</hi> 33.18. for I muſt needs ſee it, and thy face too before I have done, that I may be able to ſay with <hi>Jacob:</hi> After all my wreſtlings <hi>I have ſeen God face to face; and the life of my ſoul is now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, Gen.</hi> 32.26. O ſweet ſight: O that all my Readers might ſee it and be able to ſay, we have ſeen his glory, as the glory of the only begotten Son of God <hi>John</hi> 1.

Now this, Oh this is the principle thing, and without this all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things we need are as nothing, for without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. Nor can we truly rejoice without it, but with it we may, and its done; for proof whereof, I will bring one, who in our time did ſo rejoice, even to the admiration of all that were about him, ſo as that a godly Miniſter that ſaw him and heard him, ſaid, I never ſaw, never read, never heard the like; for thus he ſpoke of his joy in believing, <hi>I am as ful of joy as I can hold, O that I could but let you know what I do feel: This is a kin to Heaven, and if I were not to enjoy any more than this,</hi> it were well worth all the torments that men and Divels can invent, to come through, yea even a Hell, to ſuch tranſcendent joys as theſe: I ſtand, as it were, with one foot in Heaven. I hear the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody of Heaven, I ſee the Angels watching for me <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here a moſt needful Queſtion cometh to be anſwered. How ſhall I come by this Faith and rejoycing? I anſwer as the wiſe Virgins did the fooliſh, craving ſome of their Oyl, whereby we may underſtand Faith, which, like Oyl maketh chearful, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.2. <hi>Go to thoſe that ſell, Mat.</hi> 25.9. And who be they? Secondly I anſwer. 1. The Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and firſt the Father ſelleth it freely, for he gives it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. And therefore you muſt go to him for it, ſaying, Father ſell unto me this Oyl of Faith, giving it unto me, that I may rejoice with joy unſpeakable. 2. The Son ſelleth it; for he is the Author of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. So as that to him you muſt go and ſay alſo, ſweet Jeſus ſell unto me that Oyl of Faith, that I may rejoyce with Joy unſpeakable. And thirdly to the Spirit, who freely and givingly ſells it, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. You muſt cry alſo, bleſſed Spirit, ſell unto me alſo that holy Oyl of Faith, that I may rejoyce gloriouſly! But hereupon another Queſtion ariſeth, How a man may know that he hath that precious Oyl of Faith and holy Joy which cometh it? Whereunto I anſwer, firſt if it purify his heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. And ſecondly if he become a true Saint, and live a truly holy life, <hi>Acts.</hi> 26.18. And thirdly if his faith work by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. And makes him love the Brethren dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unfeignedly. See 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15. And fourthly if his joy be a glorious joy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. So as that he needs not be aſhamed to ſpeak of it, how gloriouſly it works in him and by him; and what glory is brought to God by it, and by the life which he now lives, living by the faith of the Son of God, and being crucified with Chriſt to the world, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:32640:194"/>And yet I muſt anſwer one Queſtion more: You ſaid even now, that a man muſt imitate Chriſt too; and how and wherein may that be done? Whereunto I briefly anſwer, 1. in his godlineſs: For firſt, how that holy Lord Jeſus went about doing good to ſouls by his powerful Preaching, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.23. Secondly, and how he faſted <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, though we cannot follow him for ſo many days, yet may we according to ſtrenth given us from above, for a day now and a day then, and even as often and as long as God ſhall direct us: and the like may be ſaid by his praying whole nights upon a Mountain, <hi>Luke</hi> 6: 12. And ſecondly we ſhould imitate him in his meekneſs, and not be ſo angry and provoking as many are. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. Thirdly in his humbleneſs, for how he humbled himſelf by counting himſelf of no Reputation, and by coming in the form of a ſervant <hi>&amp;c.
